The goal of this contest is to see how different creators tackle a certain theme and have the community vote on the best entry. To participate, all you have to do is create and submit a level that adheres to the provided requirements. You will find them below:\n\nSMM-GAF Contest #1\n\nTheme: Level 1-1 for a new Mario game\nDescription: Creating the first level for an entirely new Mario platformer must be a tough task for the level designers at Nintendo. Certain traditions of 1-1 stages must be respected while also avoiding the dangers of being derivative. Now it's up to you to create a level that would serve as the very first stage of a new Mario game. Think about what direction the game goes in. Think about a new idea that might be featured more heavily and expanded on in certain ways as the game progresses. The first impression is what counts, right?\nStyles: All Styles allowed\n\nSubmission deadline: Monday, Sep 21 (12pm GMT+1)\nVoting period: Monday, Sep 21 - Monday, Sep 28 (12pm GMT+1)\n\n\nSubmission Rules:\n\nTo submit a level, post the code of your level along with a screenshot in this very thread and clearly label it as entry for the contest by putting the following on the top of your post: 'Submission for the SMM-GAF Community Contest #1'.\n\nKeep in mind that only one entry per user is allowed. If you wanna retract a level and submit a new one, make that absolutely clear and edit your old post to reflect that change. Please refrain from doing this a lot, better be absolutely sure that the stage you created is the one you wanna submit.\n\nYou can label your level in a way that relates it to our contest but you don't have to. Just make sure to properly submit a level in here by following the rules above.\n\nVoting Rules:\n\nOnce the deadline for submitting levels is reached, I will assemble all the entries and post the list in here. SMM-GAF will then go ahead and try the levels. You can assign points to up to three levels - your first pick gets three points, your second pick two points, your third pick one point.\n\nYou can give feedback in the thread and reveal your ranking if you wish. However, you must send me your ballot in a PM, this ensures anonymity for those who want it and, more importantly, gives me an easier time counting your votes.\n\nThe deadlines for submitting and voting will be posted above. Feel free to quote this post on a new page to spread the word!\n\nI should say that the first three winners will be included in the Community Showcase! However, I hope that, first and foremost, a contest like this will help people focus their creativity while trying to work around restrictions (which will undoubtedly become more strict in later tournaments!). Most importantly, though, I hope that everyone has a fun time!\n\n\n\nIn the Community Showcase I would like to display GAFfer-made levels. If you have played a level you deem worthy, just post about it in the thread or shoot me a PM.\n\n1. Smokin' Skull Stream by Nocturnowl (ID: B4D8-0000-0012-345C)\n\n\n\nAn excellent level that is very reminscent of the game it lent its assets from, it provides a challenge that is always fair thanks to thoughtful design.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by King_Moc\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGood stage! These are the kind of levels we need.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kensuke\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tVery nice and challenging. I was sweating a little towards the end, but somehow managed it.\r\n2. Jr's Water Park by Kinsei (ID: EABD-0000-0014-D904)\n\n\n\nThis wonderfully creative stage manages to build up a sense of place and a sense of cohesiveness like few others do. The change-up between castle and water theme is pulled off very well, and some of the enemy patterns are among the most interesting I've seen in any water level. Usually, a high level of creativity sends the difficulty curve flying in all sorts of directions, but not here! A very fun ride, indeed.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by mrklaw\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThis was a fantastic level. Maybe a little too chaotic wih thegoombas in the water section, but it was really tense and heart stopping at times. Love the back and forth too, really fleshes it out and gives it a feeling of space.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Sparf (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLovely and inventive design choices!\r\n3. Little Pikmin Adventure by Robin64 (ID: E088-0000-0018-E993)\n\n\n\nNot a difficult stage, probably not even a challenging one. But an exemplary display of how to do a stage with a character theme and a clever approach on how to do a lot with very little while being obscenely charming to boot. The Mario equivalent of a praline!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Nocturnowl\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSimple but effective in how you used the enlarged enemies to create that sense of scale for the Pikmin.\nI didn't actually know you could be a trio of pikmin, such a neat skin.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by The Wotch (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThat was adorable. And I found Olimar!\r\n4. Sunken Airship by Dimentios (ID: 2053-0000-0012-5786)\n\n\n\nSometimes there's something to be said for rock solid level design. This stage doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does manage to evoke a sense of wonder of exploring a sunken ship, effortlessly combining underwater and ship sections, with very natural enemy placement and a nice sense of pace.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Moe (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGreat attention to detail!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Ricardo (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tExcellent level! Fun theme, reasonable challenge. Keep up the good work!\r\n5. Tonight I Dine On Turtle Soup by ToastyFrog (ID: EDD0-0000-0024-CA8E)\n\n\n\nMany people have tried to recreate stages from other game in Mario Maker. Few have succeeded in the way T-Frog does in his adaptation of the bomb defusal stage from TMNT on the NES. A transformative effort that is as creative as it is fun.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Robin64\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSuperb! Nicely done. Not just a good homage to TMNT but a good swimming level in its own right.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by ehhh (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOddly, more fun than the original...\r\n6. Ruined Castle Romp by Insidious Walrus (ID: 6684-0000-0034-1BD7)\n\n\n\nA different kind of castle stage but a castle stage nonetheless. Filled with lots of alternate paths and secrets, the level gets a chance to breathe without feeling loose and empty. Every obstacle is meticulously and harmoniously placed - a study in elegance despite its brutalistic theme.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Belgian Dude\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tReally really fun! Congrats - difficult yet fair - the fireball segment was pretty tough for me! Really like the shortcut over the Thwomps.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Dad\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOk, of the traditional Super Mario levels so far, I think this is by far my favorite. It's just REALLY tightly designed. Incredible work\r\n7. Pipe-opolis by UncleSporky (ID: BA66-0000-002A-4DB2)\n\n\n\nA master class in pipe level design. Contrary to most level of a similar aesthetic, the stage doesn't feel cluttered and chaotic. It flows brilliantly and is a testament to the creator's eye for striking layout and geometry. A phantastical piple jungle that needs to be experienced.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by jholmes\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIt’s 1990 and there’s a new World 7 stage! The hidden area near the end was vintage SMB3. Very good stage, definitely one of the best I’ve played. Big-time recommend.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Crimson_Justice\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tDarn good level right here. I agree with you on the nice aesthetic and the end as a cave being better - it felt like I made my way out of a pipe maze and was satisfying.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nThe GAF creator database (courtesy of ramparter)\n\nNOTE: Only one level is enough. The purpose is to allow you the other gaffers to find you, follow you and get to see your other levels too.\n\nQuote post to see the form link here:\nForm\n\nQuote post to view the levels here:\nLevels\n\nAnd last, but not least - UncleSporky's Guide For Designing Good™ Mario Levels\n\n\r\n\t\t"

I couldn't tell when to keep turtle shells and when to drop them for the next section. My first death was from holding a shell and the turtle popped back out at me.\r\n\r\nThe intro section was too long and I always had one she'll get away from me and respawn, mostly at the raised blocks.  Consider making the user only need to break one block each wall here.  \r\n\r\nThe 3 ? Blocks with turtles annoyed me.  The first time I got there I popped all three and died trying to get on the ledge.  Consider making 1 ? Block with bricks on either side, unless you wanted that to be a challenge.  \r\n\r\nThe section after, with the big turtle pipe, I accidently kicked the big she'll into the pit on the right .  Because he was still alive no more came out of the pipe, but he was in too tight of a spot to effectively get.  Not sure what the ideal fix would be here.\r\n\r\nAfter this I fell into the pit the first time.  If you want a hole here maybe telegraph it better.\r\n\r\nThe turtle with the springs was a fun grab but was tedious if you let the turtle get away destroying the next set of blocks.\r\n\r\nI like bouncing the big turtles but was confused on what to do at the top.  I went back and grabbed the propeller cap but that made the flag pole run up too easy.  Was I supposed to carry a turtle shell up here?  This section needs just a little more iteration and it will be pretty cool!\r\n\r\nI liked the concepts in this stage, just need some tweaks to be more forgiving if you lost a turtle, and maybe telegraph some of the traps more fairly and I think it'll be cool!\r\n\r\n(Sorry if my write up seems harsh.  I work in software qa so... if it is cold and emotionless it's nothing personal!)\r\n\t\t"

I'm sure there are more but I'm glad that Nintendo threw them in.\r\nNo, it was a level where you needed to get a Wing Cap in mid air, instantly fly up, then wall jump from 1-block pathways to unlock a Paratroopa, then go back and jump off of it over a giant Pirhana Plant.\n\nEDIT:  Anyway, here's a tutorial level I made if you want to get used to the physics:  395F-0000-0012-8C2B\r\n\t\t"

You rely WAY too much on the jumping on enemies to gain altitude gimmick without properly introducing it. Further, one of the pipes you need to clear is out of range of the Bullet Bill cannon you need to clear it, so a player can get stuck at it with no apparent way forward. Also, please don't use Bloopers for precision enemy platforming. They are anything but predictable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Wyndstryker\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust picked this up.\r\n\r\nFirst course is 5302-0000-0015-830B\r\nA running start with a long jump extended by the L/R trigger spins will take you almost to the springs.

It looks weird to see them just end. The original game ends mid-air pipes with those unbreakable non-ground blocks. Try that, maybe? Also, your level hinges entirely on the player already knowing that you can run over single tile gaps. Without that, the level is impossible.\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm being harsh. But I'd imagine that turnabout is fair play, no? I have two uploads, I would love to people to be harsh on those.\r\n\r\nStairs and Koopas: EF8A-000-0013-D293\r\nCurrently has a completion rate of 50%, which is odd since I meant for it to be easy. People keep falling into the fourth pit, can anyone see why?\r\n\r\nBullet Keep: 5E9C-0000-0015-1400\r\nThe idea is World 1/2-ish castle level.

I keep tapping along to the beat instead of drawing my objects. \r\n\r\nAlso: 317E-0000-0015-5CD5 It's my first level, and very short, but I'd like some feedback!\r\nSounds like a good way to play to me.

I just wish you could watch people play your levels.\r\nIt's short but that made me replay it after I beat it to see if I can speed through it, and realised I could do it if I wanted.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by brickwalker0\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\ti will say, that was one of the more \"authentic\" mario levels in that its very similar to standard old mario level design. but that also weighs against it when you consider there wasnt anything in particular that hasnt been done in the old ones (i might have missed some secrets though, i just got the one at the beginning and some of the boxes you have to hit with a shell). I still enjoyed it though considering most maps ive played feel like a few lucky jumps, yours felt like an actual level.\r\nThank you. Yeah, I was going for a very standard mario level design. There is another secret that enables you to reach the top of the flagpole. Though it's probably also nothing new. Hint: You have to jump off of a red Koopa Troopa\r\n\t\t"

The clown car sounds really nice but I think it'd be too bulky and floaty to use.  Likewise, Bowser Jr.'s sax which you could only ever play 3 notes on.\r\nThis is insanity.

I don't think Nintendo's basic approach is flawed, but there are some elements�thinking specifically of the ability to create sub-levels�that are too limiting. It means I've got a (admittedly gimmicky, more on that in a second) concept built that is waiting for the unlock. Yes, I can game the system to move it along, but for me this is a basic component of Mario level design that shouldn't be locked in the way it is.\r\n\r\nBut it says a lot about me that when presented with limits, my mind goes to \"What can I easily signify/finish?\" versus necessarily breaking it down into level design components. If I had more time, it's possible I'd be adjusting minute details, but in \"dipping into\" the game on the first day I didn't necessarily feel inspired to go as deep as I've seen others do here and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI've got a third level that I'm content with ready to go in the morning, but here are the two I built today.\r\n\r\nTrust Fall:\r\nCourse ID: C774-0000-0017-B0D2\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty short course, which I built more to test how many people were using the thumbnail�in retrospect, I'm realizing that the 100 Marios mode may not feature thumbnails, so it became tougher than perhaps I intended.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Truth\r\nCourse ID: 30B3-0000-0019-4996\r\n\r\nA good insight into my day one thought process: starting playing around with blocks, made an equals sign, and the (gimmicky) idea built from there. I think I'll probably end up with a few silly ideas like this one that help break down other design elements (which I had to use to fill out the rest of the level).\r\n\t\t"

Three hours to make, thirty seconds to complete. It's less of a challenge than it is a spectacle-laden commentary on the lot in life Thwomps face, and it's awesome I can do that because of how much room there is for non-traditional level design in this game.  I was also drunk while designing the back-half of the course, so there's that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43B6-0000-001D-C47D\r\n\t\t"

It is positively insane how much fine-tuning goes into creating a stable and even level - it seems like a process that could go on forever. \n\n43B6-0000-001D-C47D\r\nYa it's a neat insight into the game design. Little things like placing a Koopa suddenly gives the player a weapon and might totally trivialize something later in the level.  Place something crazier like yoshi and now you're stuck between balancing a level with people who lose yoshi and people who keep it.\r\n\t\t"

They're part of the scenery. They shouldn't count. Everything else sure. ? blocks, enemies, platforms, anything that moves or is interactive is fine, but a solid non moving block shouldn't count. It makes no sense really.\r\nAnd coins are in the same 'batch' of items as blocks, so if I add blocks I can't add coins. I had to cheat and put pipes as walls because it was the only solid thing that was left for me to put, heh.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Belgian Dude\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLo' and behold, my first level! I actually ran out of ground blocks and had to get creative.\nUsing platforms in a way that doesn't let you stand in a place for too long.\n\nSpent a lot of time in the visual, but I think the design is good as well. It introduces you both concepts separately, then joins them together in different ways.\n\nThere's 3 hidden 1-Ups in the level, hope you enjoy it!\n\nSawblade Stump\n99CF-0000-001E-43FA \n\n\r\nReposting for new page - need more feedback! (I think I'll do what Ferrio did and lower the last saws a bit, as well as acommodate the level from some deaths I saw on the mini-map).\n\nAlso, this below is a proof of concept? Dunno - could be really fun to expand on that - bullet bills shoot the blocks which in turns grow infinite vines and you need to avoid Zingers and other things =P. Vines follow a track that can go up and down as well.\nTrying to simulate some DKC vine levels.\n\nVineCart Carnage\nAD53-0000-001E-AAB4\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t"

Great power-up positioning - as soon as I got hit by something that was a bit unlucky I got another one so it felt fair all the way through. The way the Hammer Bros and Beetles are positioned is also super intuitive, so good job.\r\n\r\nMy only real gripe is the Thwomp right before the bosses. When you're running up the platforms your instinct is to continue jumping, but then an off-screen Thwomp hits you. If you're small that means a death.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, really good course.\r\n\t\t"

I appreciate all the descriptions everyone is giving for their levels, but they're practically blending together at this point.\n\nSomething like:\n\nLevel Name:\nGame Style:\nDifficulty:\nBrief Description:\nCode:\n\n...Could help people searching for levels they're actually interested in instead of getting burned out on pulling random codes from here. It's not perfect, but something along those lines might be good.\n\nEdit: and to all those clever folks quoting me above and pointing out how dumb you think my original comment is, I honestly can't see how you would enjoy scrolling through pages of people sharing ambiguously described levels with little discussion of the actual game (I enjoy reading OTs for that purpose, so apologies if that's unheard of). It's bound to get \"worse\" over time, too.\r\n\nI like the format, thanks!\n\nLevel Name: Smooth Jumping\nGame Style: Momentum-focused Mario level\nDifficulty: Easy to Normal\nBrief Description: This level is basically made so you can keep your momentum going while jumping on narrow-ish platforms.

I unlocked the Shy Guy costume and had an idea.\r\n\r\nC5AA-0000-001B-78DE\r\n\r\nI uploaded it last night, and I'm surprised it only has about a 9% completion rate. I don't think it's that hard, but perhaps that's partly because I know what's coming.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any way to see where people die on the sub-screen? It's pretty cool being able to see that on the map of the main screen and could be helpful in finding out what ideas might need some tweaking if I ever want to reuse them.\r\nI just gave it a go and beat it on my fourth try. I agree that it becomes easier when you know what's ahead and therefore are given time to assess how to overcome the obstacles. The problem is, most people seem to just give a level 1 or 2 goes before moving onto the next which is where the low completion rate comes from. \r\n\r\nFor the level itself, I liked the second room as I was forced to actually do something while on the platform, which is a problem I've run into when designing my own levels. However you can break the boos if you quickly look left and right over and over and I am guilty of taking advantage of this :p You were also very generous with additional one ups, which is a good thing for the impatient players. I'm not sure if you can see where player die on your level (although I agree that it would be a MUCH welcomed feature) but if it helps, I died a couple times in the third room with the circling boos and there were a whole lot of deaths in that small room.\r\n\t\t"

From the title I was expecting something peaceful... A couple oddities aside (the random thwomp at the start of the level and the buzzy beetle who jumps into the lava before you can close to him) I really liked this stage. It promotes a style of play where you die a bunch, but learn what's ahead and how best to tackle it next time. The skull platforms were well placed and I assume took a lot of playtesting to get right. That goes for the fireballs and hammer bro. which could have been placed in more intrusive places but felt fair. The only problem I had was the thwomp army at the end which honestly felt cheap and unnecessary since Bowser's enough of a threat himself. Aside from that though, I really liked this one.\r\n\r\nUnderwater Shenanigans - This one was much easier I felt and I liked that there was always something going on which I had to be aware of. The Koopas halfway into the stage felt like they were placed a little off (the corridor felt a bit too narrow) but eh, it might just be me. Nothing much else to say about this one, very solid and nothing too difficult (although I've always found the water levels to be the easiest Mario levels so maybe it's just that.)\r\n\t\t"

I didn't finish this one because the koopa kept getting stuck when I hit one of the blocks because he wouldn't get on the trampoline. If the start of the level wasn't tedious I'd probably have gone back and finished it. You should start out with the koopa right away, in my opinion. If you remake the course I'd definitely try it again! :) I love the idea!\n\nTesting them now. Will leave feedback here.\n\nLeaps of Faith\n\nThe falling Spinies pissed me off. Haha. I like the concept of the timing long jumps, though!  Beat it, too. :)\r\n\t\t"

The ice blocks do a lot to restrict movement right off the bat, and so does the hazard-heavy level design (including Bowser who literally makes you freeze in place if you let him!) This is fine, but the challenge should come from things the player can control, and banging your head off the ceiling while avoiding things struck me as arbitrary. Mario levels allow for this great freedom of movement, and even difficult levels should remember that. The worst thing about the ceiling is since it's so tight on small Mario, going into the bonus room is pointless because getting big makes you more likely to fall in the lava. Also a pet peeve, but the first fireball feels like a beginner's trap more than a well placed hazard: Mario games are about jumping, and the first one should be free, I think.\r\n\r\nWith that said there's a lot to like. The puzzle room itself is inspired, tough and fun. The ice blocks themselves are well laid out and at many times you've gone out of your way to make the jumps quite fair. Conceptually, I like the level too: not just the combo of fire and ice, but also the tetrominoes as platforms, the beetles as hazards and the use of small platforms in a Bowser stage. At the end of the day I just thought it was too hard (I did beat it) which makes me concerned about constantly playing super-hard levels given so many people here said your level was well balanced!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you keep up the good work. I'm definitely interested in what you do next.\r\n\t\t"

If you can make the normal overworld music play, I'd love to know how you did it. I'd recommend checking this one out in edit mode, though, setting up alternate music is very cumbersome. If you can do it with fewer triggers than I did, I'd like to know how.\r\nSecrets: Three 1-Up MushroomsI'm sorry that I can't play anyone else's level right now, but I have to rest my arm.

Got carpal tunnel in my ZL-trigger finger. So much copying for airship levels...\r\n\r\nBut if anyone is curious what a level that can cause that looks like, it looks like this:\r\nJunior's Flying Flotilla\r\n\r\n7A70-0000-0022-16DB\r\nDescription: I'm going for the the \"Show, teach, challenge, flourish\" method for a level. It's divided into an autoscrolling athletic part and a slower puzzle part leading up to a battle. Please notice how the boss music is set up, too.\r\n\r\nOf particular note, I'd like feedback on the Bob-ombs. Especially how that is introduced.\r\nSecrets: Three 1-Up MushroomsI also did an amiibo thing, but this level has some obvious flaws... that I didn't notice until after it was uploaded. \r\nFrom Skyworld with Love\r\n\r\nD3F4-0000-0020-E0C5\r\nDescription: I wanted to make a Palutena level. The level has an easy way and a hard way. Both are pictured in that screenshot. Trust in her who makes the grind rails... or don't and go Dry Bones hopping.\r\n\r\nAlso, making the alternate music play like that is tougher than you'd think. If you can make the normal overworld music play, I'd love to know how you did it. I'd recommend checking this one out in edit mode, though, setting up alternate music is very cumbersome. If you can do it with fewer triggers than I did, I'd like to know how.\r\nSecrets: Three 1-Up MushroomsI'm sorry that I can't play anyone else's level right now, but I have to rest my arm. Haven't had a game do this to me in a long, long time... I guess I have a clear GOTY candidate for me here.\r\nJunior's flying flotilla is fantastic - really feels like a proper Mario world level. Lots of nice little features \r\n- general use of the flame throwers pointing in the direction that the airship is travelling which helps anchor he forced scrolling \r\n- I like the switch between forced scrolling and static\r\n- first sight of the Bob-omb is really neat mechanically\r\n- the last use of the Bob-omb is both great and mean ;)\r\n\t\t"

Last I saw the completion % was around 10%. \n\n5673-0000-001D-33BE\r\nIt has potential. I think with a bit of adjusting, it could be pretty fun. The ending felt a bit underwhelming compared to the start and there was a pipe towards the end of the wall jumping that was slightly receded inwards, making jumping up in that section awkward. I would have liked to see a wall jumping section with the giant plants or some other variation. Maybe line all of the walls with plants and give the player a star or something fun like that.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Insidious_Walrus\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLady Siara: I liked a lot of the platforming in your level. Getting the trampoline was a slow part of the level, though, and I had to repeat it a few times after deaths.\r\nFair complaint. I tried to make the sections after it a bit more forgiving to avoid that but I can see it being a pain.\r\n\t\t"

Funny how the Mario World levels are so full of saws.\n\nDid you update your level without deleting the old one? Is that an option?\n\nHow did you generate the screenshot of the course?\r\nHehe, yeah, saws abound. I wanted to do a track platform level where you couldn't really stay in a platform and had to dodge them somewhat quickly - I hope it worked pretty nicely/\n\nI had to delete the old one so there aren't two of the same. Hope they update it in a future patch.\n\nIf you're talking about in-game screenshot it takes a shot near where you are when you tap upload, so I 'gamed the system' and went to a place I thought it'd look good. For the banner, played the level, got into imgur, uploaded the images, then threw all five into photoshop and mashed them together.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Stoze\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAw man, I just played the old one. I'll check the newer version tomorrow, but I really liked your level. I actually downloaded it see how to get into the pipe, was way too tired after 10 hours of playing to find it myself, plus I hadn't tried dl'ed a level yet.\n\nI'm completely burnt out of Mario for the day, can barely focus on the game and my eyes are killing me.\r\nIt's not really different though, just some tweaks to make it a tad easier near the end and I shuffled some boxes around. Thanks a lot, though - and yeah, the pipe is pretty tricky, but I think it'd be fair for something secret-exit like.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Nocturnowl\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI liked the bit somewhat near the end where the three horizontal path platforms are stacked above each other with just the right timing to drop from one to the next before getting bladed, must've been fun getting the platform timing to work correctly there\nVisually it's a bit all over the place though I think you've got some overgrown vibe going on here so the vines work, alas I couldn't use them to sneak up over the top at the very start.\nNot too tricky so I wouldn't worry about difficulty. \nAs for more constructive feedback, I suppose sometimes less can be more, there's all sorts of moving platforms dotted about in the early stages and some seem a bit redundant\r\nThe worst part about the drop was that I was running out of blocks, and tracks/ground are on the same counter I think. But yeah, I think I may have placed too many 'backgronds'.\n\nAnd as for too many platforms - definitely - there's a bit I hate with two moving platforms right next to each other above the exit from the pipe - but I didn't want it to be assymetrical and I can't fix because I run out of blocks. If I ever reupload it I really think I'm just going to swallow my pride and leave it assymetrical at least - as well as remove some of the other excessive stuff.\n\nThanks a lot though!\r\n\t\t"

It was really hard to make a ghost house level without things like bony beetles, fishin' boos, and so on, but I tried my best!\n\n\n\nTwisted Trial of the Boo Buddies: EF79-0000-0024-75D2\n\nPlease let me know if you find all three of the 1-up mushrooms.\r\ni managed to find one of the three (the one in the boo circle). anyway a twisted level, indeed! i found the beginning portion pretty challenging but not unreasonably so. i think you could even remove one of the mushrooms so that you can't brute force your way through the boo part leading up to the door. the highlight was undoubtedly the clown car section which i enjoyed a lot. one suggestion i have is to make the p-switch section more interesting. you pretty much know what's going to happen when you see the coins in the beginning so it would be even cooler if that expectation was subverted later!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by maxcriden\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tNew level. Of course as soon as I posted it I noticed some major flaws in its design, but I hope you all still enjoy it.\n\nbring that with you...\n\nBDE3-0000-0024-4931\n\nAny feedback would be immensely appreciated, especially since this is only my second level ever!\n\nThank you so much for a-playing my game!\r\nmax! i would have doubled down on the 'bring the spring with you' part by not offering a second one. the falling platform section could have been more challenging, adding a few more enemies into the mix would have helped, i think. a second lakitu, for example. speaking of lakitu, i really, really like the idea of lakitu flying below instead of above you. that is something that could be worked into another level, for sure!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kouriozan\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWe'll see if short and sweet levels get more stars from random people.\n\nHocus Pocus! : 31C6-0000-0024-6C33\r\na neat level to look at (ashley <3) but yeah, it is a bit short. i guess you kept it like that to see how it would fare, star-wise. i think you could totally re-use what's there and make a longer 'underground + ghost enemies' level, it's a neat combination\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Danielsan\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGot the game today and I've spend most of today creating levels.\nI'd love it if some of you checked out my latest full blown level\n\nSuper Koopa Fortess\n4D13-0000-0024-375B\n\nI've spend way too much time on that one. Feedback would be very welcome.\r\ni liked the level a lot, really cool obstacle design, the enemies are very well choreographed and your sense for architecture rounds out a great level. i have one, let's call it, medium-sized, nitpick: one third of the level is just koopa hopping which is a bit worn out at this point. i checked out the bottom part of the level and while it was super interesting to look at, i thought it was pretty much impossible. the problem with the bottom path are the fireballs. you can't see them if you're on the skull platform and one just pops up from underneath you. luckily, the aforementioned architecture makes up for a lot. if you could mix up the koopa jumping somehow, you got yourself a fantastic level. if you balance the bottom part to make it a more challenging but doable alternative, you got a virtually perfect level. also, did you put down the design note? i would remove that, let the level speak for itself! anyway, really good job, can't wait to see more from you\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Insidious_Walrus\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGolden Cliffs\nF41D-0000-001D-7020\n\nMy primary goal was to make the jump sequences feel fluid, with lots of conserved momentum, but I also threw in three secret 1-up mushrooms and some automated contraptions. Thanks to the people that have already given it a shot!\r\na very enjoyable, laid-back stage that would feel right at home in the 'easy' difficulty of 100 mario level. i've said it before but that difficulty level desperately needs more quality levels like this. i'd be excited to see you tackle a more intermediate level!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by 7threst\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMade a Super Mario World-style level, hope you enjoy if you play it :)\n\nID: 9DE0-0000-0025-1B84\r\nyou definitely nailed some of that smw feeling but some coherence wouldn't have hurt, i think. it felt like i was going from one element to the next element and i didn't really get the sense of a level. more interconnectedness could really go a long way, i think. the little scenarios themselves were solid, so if you focus on level layout next time, i think you could make something really cool! one more remark: the platform and saw blade at the start could also be timed a little better, you have to wait quite a bit for those elements to enter the playing area.\r\n\t\t"

The first one comes fast and it is seemingly random whether you are in sync to hit it with a fireball. \r\n\r\nIt's a cool concept and fun but it's a bit too random with the pacing and the spring itself can be wonky with the grab/fireball button.

It's pretty good until the bit where you have to get the spiny helmet which was a huge jump in difficulty in comparison to the others. I get that it's basically the final upgrade you need, but the gaps, endlessly spawning enemies and low ceiling made this part frustrating and soured the experience as a whole for me.\r\n\r\nI think if you tweaked that part just a little you'd have a pretty great level that most could beat.\r\n\t\t"

This first one was a rough one I made fairly quickly before work yesterday.\r\nI was able to bait the first spiny shell over before I triggered the second flying spring so it made the level a lot easier.  That first one was causing me heartburn but taking him out of the equation made it much easier.  So placing him further away will prevent cheesing and will also give the player more time to orient themselves.  The star section is cool but there is so much on the screen I had a hard time keeping track of where the spring was, but otherwise great concept!

I was just having fun. :P Those three pipes at the end are only one screen large and it makes a buzzing sound so you get immediate feedback as to whether or not you made it to the end... so, yeah, it's not too bad.

Should you enjoy them (and I hope you do!), stars would be much appreciated.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\tName: Manor Madness\nChallenge: Find Yoshi & Finish The Level With Him\nDifficulty: Low\nDescription: This is the level which came together while I was working my way through all the unlocks, meaning it's packed with almost every tile/enemy/item in the game. There's no cohesion to it, but I enjoyed playing it, so, after some refinement, stuck it online. See if you can find the secret room with three 1ups!\nDesign Philosophy: I experimented with a few optional 'puzzles', which came together quite well, I thought. Each can be beaten fairly easily without working out my intentions, but using the environment/throwable enemies intelligently and you can save a little time. If you can get the clown ship, you can finish the rest of the level with no obstacles at all, but it's difficult to pull off and mostly there to tempt people into making a rash decision during a tense moment. I tried to include a couple of alternate paths as well.\n\nCode: 3509-0000-0028-38F8\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tName: Head Hop Heights\nChallenge: Collect All 35 Coins\nDifficulty: Low-Medium (higher if you haven't mastered the trampoline timing)\nDescription: This is the first level I designed, prior to most of the unlocks. The main challenge comes from the sections where you have to use flying koopas and/or trampolines to cross chasms. Once you've got the timing down, it's pretty simple.\nDesign Philosophy: I wanted to do a Bopopolis-style level, but for my first submission, focused first and foremost on keeping the level fun and not exceedingly complex. To compensate for the lack of checkpoints, I put the main area of difficulty in the middle, with everything thereafter relatively straightforward. The coin challenge isn't difficult when you know where the coins are, and for those hidden initially out of sight or at the apex of a timed jump, I tried to make sure you could go back and try again once the relevant koopa had regenerated. I tried to introduce mechanics asymetrically, so you wouldn't always know what was coming up next.\n\nCode: 78DC-0000-0027-E2FF\r\n\r\n\t\t"

This is once again asking the player to one tile jumps, having no forgiveness via powerups or otherwise to allow the user to even make a single mistake. Like for example, I have no idea what the purpose of the giant goomba that's bouncing around, but for me, it just makes the jump harder. Also, what were intending with the green shell & pipe with the firey piranha in that same section. Killed myself enough times trying to mess around that I skipped that. If I was on the upper-side of the map, there was at least one blind spot into a huge gap. While I didn't run into the sideways springs, I feel like they're almost just an extra annoyance/being mean as opposed to challenging anyone.\n\nFor example, I'd at least take out the last fire piranha in the stack of Koopa Troopas at the end. But hey it's day 1/2, so I'm expecting folks to get a bunch better as time goes on :), especially since you're asking for feedback and trying to improve. Sorry if the commentary was a bit harsh though.\r\n\t\t"

[014A-0000-001C-9CAD]\r\n\r\nThe Megalithic Castle - Definitely my hardest \"standard\" level so far, this one is... well, it's a big castle! Make it to the end and fight the big Bowser boss!

I would leave the coins you have above the long jump, and shorten the gap below, in a way that if a newbie jumps off the top with the intent to get the coins, and isn't running, they land safely on the bottom if pushing right.\r\n\t\t"

However, he'll need that Goomba disguise in order to bypass the security checkpoints. Can you make it through without being unmasked?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis one took a lot of attempts to clear, but I stuck with it which is a good sign. I enjoyed the creative rationale behind the level and it's obstacles. I can't fault much in your design as the challenges was there but beatable with practise.\r\n\r\nI had a hard time with the big conveyor belt jump because it at a point in the level where I couldn't practise it enough and didn't realise it required all the momentum to clear the spike pit.  I think this level would've benefited from a checkpoint perhaps after the fireball/vine section, but that's a flaw of the tool set not your design. \r\n\r\nA gripe that could perhaps be addressed is in the section where you ascend three levels of spike tops. I didn't like how the gap each side isn't wide enough, so if you abort a jump you can still get collected trying to escape down the side. This combined with the way the camera pans up did introduce an element of luck to this section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Hinchy\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tPut together a Super Mario World airship level, \"Sledge Bro's Frightening Fleet\".

Lots of nice little features \r\n- general use of the flame throwers pointing in the direction that the airship is travelling which helps anchor he forced scrolling \r\n- I like the switch between forced scrolling and static\r\n- first sight of the Bob-omb is really neat mechanically\r\n- the last use of the Bob-omb is both great and mean ;)\r\nI will gladly admit to stealing the first two from Super Mario Bros 3. Flame jets to enforce scrolling and every airship ended with a static boss fight. I just made the boss room a lot bigger.\r\n\r\nI'm glad the introduction seems to work. I put the Super Mushroom there to give the player something to do while waiting. Also, if Mario is small, the freeze when transforming gives you time to notice the Bob-omb if you already hadn't. I thought of a better twist for the final Bob-omb, but I'm not going to update it. I'll just press on and do better next level.\r\n\r\nJust for the record, we're talking about this level: Junior's Flying Flotilla (7A70-0000-0022-16DB)\r\n\t\t"

Now, I assumed they'd move at the same speed, and cross one another and then travel to opposite ends---and in editing, that's what happened.\r\n\r\nYet when I went to upload the track, when I got to that part, the saws suddenly were traveling right next to one another which doesn't make any sense...so it ruined the level because you had to jump over them when they crossed, which no longer occurred as they traveled side-by-side now. I had to remove that segment because it was impossible to clear, and just changed it to one saw.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the level had the same glitch happen---I had six saws that intersected, and in editing they did just that, but when I played the level to upload it, the timing was totally off---this time, though, it actually worked to my advantage because the challenge was still there just the timing was different from what I planned, but still possible to clear.\r\n\r\nMade me mad---but anyway, here's the level...\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAGON ROAD!\r\n28AD-0000-002A-7364\r\n\r\nThis...this one is pretty tough.\r\n\r\nI feel like, rule of thumb, if you the creator can't clear your level 50% of the time, maybe it's too difficult or luck based---this one actually challenge me quite a bit, but I think it came out pretty good. There's a few segments where I found it was easier to just take a hit, but I guess even among real Mario levels there are segments where I've used the mercy invincibility to pass so I wasn't too bothered.

It mostly involves exploring simple interactions with the springboard, particularly its new horizontal configuration. My aim was to create something interesting using only the elements unlocked by day 2 (the first row and a half, up to the 1UP mushroom), structure it with the clarity and fairness of a typical Nintendo level, provide multiple solutions to obstacles where possible, and set up tricky but optional challenges with proportionate rewards. Ideally this approach to design would benefit from NSMB-style bonus coins, but I made do with what I had.\r\n\r\nSomething I learnt in the process: Lakitu wrecks the difficulty balance of a stage if you are not careful, as you may inadvertently set up a sudden swing from hard (while he's alive) to trivially easy (especially if player is able to ride the cloud). And if you want to control where the player has the opportunity to take him out, he imposes a severe height restriction on the traversable terrain. He was prominently featured in early drafts of the stage but I wound up removing him.\r\n\t\t"

And by the way, good job: 2-4 has pretty good pacing for an autoscroller and I really liked the airship feel. \n\nHowever, 2-1 has got to be my favourite (though I died a couple times in the cloud segment) - it's super well paced and speedrunning feels super satisfying. The idea of getting the switch and coming back is great as well. You got me with the star in the lower route, though, I destroyed the bettle sheel and couldn't get the mushroom. I think another power-up somewhere could be fun.\n\n2-2 is a fun underwater level that serves its purpose. It's entertaining (though the ? block in the alcove being assymetrical puts me off because I'm stupid) and it was fun. It's the only one where the Boo doesn't feel like a big threat though. 2-3 was fun (Mario Kart stage, woop woop) but kinda easy for its purpose and also too simplistic for my tastes. It's the one I least liked, but it's still pretty well paced.\n\nGreat job and I look forward for more!

And thus, it felt too short (even though playing through a different route shows that it's not really the case) - after the first Hammer Bros. set (barely messing with the first platform) I get the Cape and blast straight to the finish line - a bit of a bummer in an otherwise pretty solid stage.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kalaidos\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI also attempt to create stages that are based on the classic formula (introduce - expand - modify), while hopefully keeping the difficutly low enough to not become frustrating but remain challenging.\n\nHere's a level I made that I'm pretty happy with:\nIt revolves around a slight puzzle mechanic that is introduced at the beginning and then continually expanded upon.

It's kinda hard for me to put myself into the role of a random player playing the level for the first time and to introduce the level mechanics in a \"fail-safe\" way.\r\nLoved it! Really well-designed and it builds up so nicely. Loved the segment where you throw the shell at some springs and it goes through a path above - and I love how it's sort of split in two similar airships. The top part in the first leading to a bonus being mirrored with the second part (now with spikes on the platforms for added challenge) was really really nice.\n\nI do feel, however, that spawning out enemies instead of empty shells would make things more intuitive. Particularly since you can pass through Clouds from below, it sorta makes you feel like you need to use it as a helmet (SMW being the only style where you can throw it up doesn't help).\n\nBesides that - my only complaint is that I don't like Bowser Jr. It does serve as an interesting fight but imo the space is too constrained and I just find him as not a good boss, so it sorta makes the end lack a bit of the impact the other areas had. Now if you had to beat Bowser Jr. by throwing shells into holes and watching them as they went through a maze and hit him, I think it'd be better and more in the spirit of the level (more difficult to make, of course). Still - that's minor, and I really loved the course.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Tidalwave\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tHere are my first two levels...\n\n\"P\" in the clouds\n(F45A-0000-002B-C873)\n-Easy-\n\n\n\n\nWalking the Dogs\n-Hard-\n(E643-0000-002B-0DA1)\n\nMessage me your thoughts :)\r\nPlayed the first one. Harder than you think it is: SMW style (at least for me) makes it super easy to accidentaly throw a switch away - you should definitely have refills - and some of the positions of the flying spinies make it really uncomfortable to stay put while waiting for the switch to end. Really liked the part right after the flying spinies, though, made me rush a lot.\r\n\t\t"

Many tries later I finally got it.\n\nIf I had to sum up my complaints there's a lot of random stuff going on...hammer bros on platforms, kamek, boos, flying bowser, jumping lava balls while I'm riding an unfamiliar track high above the lava...so many places to die because you haven't dialed in the routine or it changed on you slightly. \nA mushroom could have helped with that.\n\nAlso, that thwomp after the door catches me really often...I'm kinda feeling it at that point and then I have to slowdown so I don't die from getting into a groove.\n\nStill, really great first effort\r\n\t\t"

It has different paths and solutions to add a little replayability.\r\n\r\nI'll upload tomorrow and share it with you guys.\r\nNow I need some sleep.\r\nSo I finally completed work on the first level:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld 1-1: Bowser imprisoned Mario\r\n17D6-0000-002D-29DE\r\n\r\nBowser, evil King of Koopas has captured Mario and imprisoned him in his castle.\r\nSlowly starving to death, Mario reminisces about his adventures, while suddenly a loud bang echoes through the dark castle.\r\n\r\nOur beloved plumber has got some unexpected help from a mysterious ally...\r\n\r\nReplayability:\r\n- Different paths\r\n- Find the 3 hidden 1-ups\r\n- Collect 100 coins\r\n\r\nThe level is rather challenging but I've tweaked it as much as possible so that it never feels cheap. \r\n\r\nHope some of you will take the time to play it and give some proper feedback. \r\nI've spent alot of time on this level to make it as perfect as I can.\r\n\t\t"

Only real issues comes inherent to vertical stages in this game where the camera can make you jump up unknowingly into a paratroopa backside but there's not much to be done there.\nThough that one goomba on the first screen does drop in from who knows where.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by QuixoticNeutral\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMy first creation is up. Playtesting and feedback would be appreciated.\n\nIt Might as Well Be Spring\n(128A-0000-002B-853E)\n\n\n\nThis stage should be fairly straightforward for Mario veterans. It mostly involves exploring simple interactions with the springboard, particularly its new horizontal configuration. My aim was to create something interesting using only the elements unlocked by day 2 (the first row and a half, up to the 1UP mushroom), structure it with the clarity and fairness of a typical Nintendo level, provide multiple solutions to obstacles where possible, and set up tricky but optional challenges with proportionate rewards. Ideally this approach to design would benefit from NSMB-style bonus coins, but I made do with what I had.\n\nSomething I learnt in the process: Lakitu wrecks the difficulty balance of a stage if you are not careful, as you may inadvertently set up a sudden swing from hard (while he's alive) to trivially easy (especially if player is able to ride the cloud). And if you want to control where the player has the opportunity to take him out, he imposes a severe height restriction on the traversable terrain. He was prominently featured in early drafts of the stage but I wound up removing him.\r\nThis may be my favourite SMB1 stage so far, such interesting use of sideways springs, I had no idea you could manipulate enemies like that.\nIt's like a mini puzzle getting the mushroom and fireflower power ups, great use of limitations.\n\nThough I do wonder, is small mario supposed to be unable to reach the spring ? block by the spiny hat pipe? You can alternatively use small mario to wear the spiny hat and take out the koopa tower from below and tackle the stage with a head of block destruction but I'm not entirely sure if you meant for this two ways of doing things. Well you did say multiple solutions so I'm guessing yes.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kalaidos\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI also attempt to create stages that are based on the classic formula (introduce - expand - modify), while hopefully keeping the difficutly low enough to not become frustrating but remain challenging.\n\nHere's a level I made that I'm pretty happy with:\nIt revolves around a slight puzzle mechanic that is introduced at the beginning and then continually expanded upon. I would gladly appreciate any sort of feedback.\n\nShip Security Shells\n\n\n\nID: CF6C-0000-0023-1B29\n\n\nIt's always surprising to see how much easier your own stages appear to yourself, whereas other players struggle at parts of your level that appear trivial at first. It's kinda hard for me to put myself into the role of a random player playing the level for the first time and to introduce the level mechanics in a \"fail-safe\" way.\r\nMore spring shenanigans, now with shells and it's pretty great.\nIt really executes the introduce gimmick and ramp it up style of design well, on top of that the use of airship and cloud platforms is thematically pleasing.\nVery cool this one.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by foomfoom415\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI took a shot at a Super Mario World Level (there aren't enough of these) \n\nIt's my first level so it's probably a bit aimless, but any feedback is very much appreciated. \n\nTowers and Tunnels  (F1D5-0000-0023-489E)\n\r\nSolid stage, changes I'd propose are pretty much all enemy based.\n- Hammer Bro near the start sometimes just leaps down to the ground, these guys can be a bugger to place effectively.\n- the Spike tops in the cave could be trimmed in number a bit, granted when you reach the cape it's spin death city for them.\n- The final flight section I managed to get through first try but I feel like that was a stroke of luck, once again maybe less obstacles?\n\nFun though, good use of verticality and sub levels.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Belgian Dude\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAlright - after 6 long hours and having to deal with the stupid ground-block limit (seriously, I filled both subscreens to the max without being halfway through the level) - here it is:\n\nDoorstop Dash - a remake from the Second Level of Donkey Kong Country 3, of course with some differences considering there are no vines you can pull. It's a rather long level but there aren't really a lot of places for you to die. Near the end I got a bit lenient with the power-ups as well.\n\nCode:\nD1E8-0000-0029-AE5E\n\n\nIf possible, try to beat the level without carrying the P-Switches.\r\nThis was always one of my least favourite DKC3 stages, I think I actually prefer this P switch variation.\nGreat homage, the DKC nut in my marked out when I found the bonus rooms and Koin equivalent intact.\nThough after picking up that 1 up I slid into its death trap for no reason, I felt foolish.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by McNum\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust for the record, we're talking about this level: Junior's Flying Flotilla (7A70-0000-0022-16DB)\r\n1 part tolerable take on the speedy SMB3 airship, other part interesting bob-omb puzzle.\nIn particular I love how the bomb is introduced and the flagpole one.\n\nOkay, I got to go make some stuff.\nEdit: After playing Ghosts in the Machine which was another fun stage, Technomancer was it?\r\n\t\t"

If you misjump, you can make it to the middle level which is just normal difficulty. The lowest level is most easiest with stars and simple platforming/patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaze Runner (No Enemies)\r\nBBC3-0000-0026-F357\r\n\r\nI created Maze Runner because I thought some people might like going through it and seeing how fast they can get through it. If you want more of a challenge, check out the other iteration of the course that is much more difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaze Runner\r\nF718-0000-0022-C617\r\n\r\nThis is an older version of the Maze Runner course that features more of a challenge with enemies placed around the course. Fair warning though, this course has a 5.12% rate and the reception has been mixed. It is my most starred level though.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's Be Frank\r\n991B-0000-0018-1475\r\n\r\nThis level is the first I uploaded but I had fun creating it with the limited tool set.

Should you enjoy them (and I hope you do!), stars would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tName: Manor Madness\r\nChallenge: Find Yoshi & Finish The Level With Him\r\nDifficulty: Low\r\nDescription: This is the level which came together while I was working my way through all the unlocks, meaning it's packed with almost every tile/enemy/item in the game. There's no cohesion to it, but I enjoyed playing it, so, after some refinement, stuck it online. See if you can find the secret room with three 1ups!\r\nDesign Philosophy: I experimented with a few optional 'puzzles', which came together quite well, I thought. Each can be beaten fairly easily without working out my intentions, but using the environment/throwable enemies intelligently and you can save a little time. If you can get the clown ship, you can finish the rest of the level with no obstacles at all, but it's difficult to pull off and mostly there to tempt people into making a rash decision during a tense moment. I tried to include a couple of alternate paths as well.\r\n\r\nCode: 3509-0000-0028-38F8\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tName: Head Hop Heights\r\nChallenge: Collect All 35 Coins\r\nDifficulty: Low-Medium (higher if you haven't mastered the trampoline timing)\r\nDescription: This is the first level I designed, prior to most of the unlocks. The main challenge comes from the sections where you have to use flying koopas and/or trampolines to cross chasms. Once you've got the timing down, it's pretty simple.\r\nDesign Philosophy: I wanted to do a Bopopolis-style level, but for my first submission, focused first and foremost on keeping the level fun and not exceedingly complex. To compensate for the lack of checkpoints, I put the main area of difficulty in the middle, with everything thereafter relatively straightforward. The coin challenge isn't difficult when you know where the coins are, and for those hidden initially out of sight or at the apex of a timed jump, I tried to make sure you could go back and try again once the relevant koopa had regenerated. I tried to introduce mechanics asymetrically, so you wouldn't always know what was coming up next.\r\n\r\nCode: 78DC-0000-0027-E2FF\r\n\r\nLatest level. This one's by far the toughest of the three, but more for punishing impatience than any great difficulty spikes. Completion rate will probably be low because it's a long level, but each of its six sections are short and offer a distinct challenge, hopefully staying fun. The Bowser fight is the only part I'm not mad about because it takes a while, so I included a few mitigating factors to help cut down the time - if you can take advantage of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tName: Bowser's Aerial Artillery\r\nChallenge: Collect The Two Fire Flowers!\r\nDifficulty: High (no trolling, not kaizo)\r\nDescription: The challenge here is more about keeping up a consistently solid performance over a long period of time than anything particularly challenging within the level itself. There are plenty of power-ups - at least one in each of the level's six 'sections' - and the level is designed so mistakes won't be punished too harshly. The clown ship section is probably the most difficult, but if you're quick and don't get distracted, it's straightforward enough. As I said, the Bowser fight drags a little, but again, it's not exceedingly difficult - and there's a way to avoid it entirely.\r\nDesign Philosophy: I wanted to make a level which would feel really, really rewarding when you reached the goal. The challenge was balancing out the difficulty over the entire level - big spikes in challenge would be disspiriting and stop people playing. I wanted to make sure players always felt like they were making progress and there was nothing holding them back but themselves. I'd much rather have been able to deactivate the timer, but it shouldn't be a problem. I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out, though would appreciate any feedback if anyone finds issues with the balance or pacing.\r\n\r\nCode: 539F-000-002E-3B56\r\n\r\n\t\t"

It's pretty basic, but I think that's also the charm. To me it feels like a course that could be in the original Super Mario Bros. It isn't based on a gimmick (like do not touch any button), it has a few hard parts, but all in all its pretty doable for every Mario-player. \r\n\r\nSo if you just want a nice chill level to play and test some of your skills, look no further than Humble Beginnings. Thanks for playing all!\r\n\r\nInformation:\r\nName: Humble Beginnings\r\nCode: 194A-0000-002D-8A7C\r\nBased on: Super Mario Bros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first level seems to be getting pretty popular, thanks for that :) It's clear my style is 'realistic mario', or in other words, Mario-levels that could be in the real games. I like it that way. Not too short, not too long, not impossible, but not that easy either.\r\n\r\nSpikey Goomba Lake\r\n\r\nI think my second level, Spikey Goomba Lake, is a bit more difficult than the first one. I for one HATE water levels with a passion but it was fun making one. It's certainly not impossible to clear this level and there are a few tricks hidden that can make the run easier. But there are also a few easter eggs that can make it harder on yourself if you find them. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I know a lot of people hate water levels, but I would love for you guys to try this one out. I'm pretty satisfied with it :) Again, its a level without weird gimmicks or impossible stuff to pass through.\r\n\r\nInformation:\r\nName: Spikey Goomba Lake\r\nCode: A071-0000-002F-1C1A\r\nBased on: Super Mario Bros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t"

It's the kind of fair difficulty that kept me retrying until I beat it. I like how the music elements are kept above out of frame like a hidden orchestra doing the level music. And of course, creating an actual musical rhythm is impressive, let alone making a fun level. \r\n\r\nI'm curious about a few things - does making it a scrolling level help with the timing of certain items like music blocks since it's not dependent on the players movement?\r\n\r\nAlso - how did you keep the regular level music from playing? Did you use a sound effect then kept it throughout?\r\n\t\t"

A straightforward A-to-B Wario level with a good rhythm of ups and downs. A bit of pizzazzy shell-activated gimmicks for progression that I don't think will trip anyone up too bad and can easily be retried if they're missed, and a little bit at the end where you have to clear a gap with a timed jump or two onto a Bullet Bill or Cheep Cheep.

The first criticism that comes to mind is that the Red Parakoopa should just be staged where he's needed, rather than coming out of the pipe. The way you have it, he doesn't activate unless you go near the pipe, and if someone takes that twisty path up right before that (which is most people's first instinct, considering the blocks leading to the pipe are mostly obscured by the lava), he won't have spawned if they jump from the top of that. He also tends to fly upwards out of reach right after exiting the pipe, making the player sit on their thumb waiting for him to get into position. I think that effect would be lessened, if not eliminated completely, if he was just flying in his intended position to start with. \n\nGranted, it would trap the player if they jump off the Koopa and don't hit the platform with the two spikes right, so I understand the thought process behind having the pipe there to spawn more, but they'd almost certainly hit the lava if they mistimed that jump anyway. They're not going to be alive to make a second chance, so planning around one is kind of a moot point.\r\n\t\t"

I know that part in the middle is kind of a dead-end if you mess up and lose the mushroom, I'll probably go back and lengthen the level and give an alternate path, or make the bit blocked off by it just lead to an optional reward rather than the rest of the level.\r\n\r\nSuper Wario Maker 1-1 - A44B-0000-002F-424C\r\nI've iterated on this one a few times, pretty happy with it. A straightforward A-to-B Wario level with a good rhythm of ups and downs. A bit of pizzazzy shell-activated gimmicks for progression that I don't think will trip anyone up too bad and can easily be retried if they're missed, and a little bit at the end where you have to clear a gap with a timed jump or two onto a Bullet Bill or Cheep Cheep. Probably won't get a lot of stars because it's not overly flashy, but I think it's a solid effort with some decent player engagement and a nice flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTried this a few times, didn't complete it, but it showed promise. The first criticism that comes to mind is that the Red Parakoopa should just be staged where he's needed, rather than coming out of the pipe. The way you have it, he doesn't activate unless you go near the pipe, and if someone takes that twisty path up right before that (which is most people's first instinct, considering the blocks leading to the pipe are mostly obscured by the lava), he won't have spawned if they jump from the top of that. He also tends to fly upwards out of reach right after exiting the pipe, making the player sit on their thumb waiting for him to get into position. I think that effect would be lessened, if not eliminated completely, if he was just flying in his intended position to start with. \r\n\r\nGranted, it would trap the player if they jump off the Koopa and don't hit the platform with the two spikes right, so I understand the thought process behind having the pipe there to spawn more, but they'd almost certainly hit the lava if they mistimed that jump anyway. They're not going to be alive to make a second chance, so planning around one is kind of a moot point.\r\nTo be honest, my first design had the flying a little bit lower and without the pipe. \r\n\r\nI added the pipe because I was afraid people would say they got stuck because they killed the Koopa. But you've certainly got a point, it wouldn't matter anyway if they screw up.\r\n\r\nWill take notes of the feedback and release a V2 someday.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\t\t"

I'm happy with the end result, and I feel like it could easily blend in with the rest of the levels in New Super Mario Bros. U.\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n\nNow, these next two stages I've posted before, but I never explained them the way I did with the new three. I will do just that and hopefully give more people the opportunity to play them. \n\n\n\n\n\nBowser's Heavy Metal Battalion\n\n (721B-0000-0025-1463)\n\nI absolutely love this stage. I wanted to make an autoscrolling level with unique boss encounters peppered in, but I also wanted to make sure the difficulty was just right... as I found the boss fight in my previous stage had caused most players to rage quit. What resulted was Bowser's Heavy Metal Battalion. It's a procession of tanks, each harder to beat than the one before it. It's got a good sense of speed, so I used Captain Falcon to convey that... and for the cool factor. The scrolling, the conveyor belts and the sawblade wheels give the illusion of moving vehicles. Kinda neat, huh?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssault on Goomba Factory\n\n(CF0E-0000-0022-6B6D)\n\nThis level was meant to be a self contained adventure story, told through sound effects. You start out outside of the factory, go inside the machine itself... see its horrors (transforming mushrooms into Goombas)... break the machine and gum up the works... then face off with the factory's malicious mastermind, Bowser, in an epic confrontation. After beating Bowser, you flee the exploding factory... just because I enjoy the cliche. It needs a little fine tuning, but it's still an awesome stage that I hope you see to the end.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, those are five stages I think you guys will have a ton of fun playing. Like I said before, if you like em' feel free to toss me a star and even follow me. PM me a list of your stages and I will play and star every single one of them. \n\nThanks for playing. (If you do!)\r\n\t\t"

Anyone curious about what this game can look like should try this stage. You have a real eye for detail: the gas lamps in the interior portion would be window dressing in a normal stage, but they're starring players here.\r\n\r\nTo the stage itself, my big problems are in the beginning: the first jump over the fire bars is too harsh, and I don't like that you've recessed the wrench moles.

Between making sure all the jumps and enemies lined up perfectly to get through each section as fast as possible and also making sure it's fun as a more casual playthrough was tough.\nNot to mention the fact that I had to restart the entire level from scratch thanks to Nintendo's limitations, and that I had to remove an entire game mechanic from the level because the tracks would de-sync. It was bad times. Turned out pretty well in the end atleast.\n\nI'm gonna be an ass and post the code again on this page:\nRescue Yoshi!\n\n8B79-0000-0030-F171\r\n\t\t"

I would've given the stage a bit more room to breathe. Here's something I try to do when playtesting my levels that might work for you: I try to beat the whole thing without power ups, to see what works.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, I like the idea! A thwomp-based castle stage is worth making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-standard stage that's half boss rush, half high-level SMB3 castle. Not really my cup of tea but much too good to not recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a way you seem like less of a game designer than you do an interior decorator. I mean that as a compliment! There are a lot of interesting things being done visually here. Anyone curious about what this game can look like should try this stage. You have a real eye for detail: the gas lamps in the interior portion would be window dressing in a normal stage, but they're starring players here.\r\n\r\nTo the stage itself, my big problems are in the beginning: the first jump over the fire bars is too harsh, and I don't like that you've recessed the wrench moles. Other than that, some people might find this too visually busy, but I say if you've got a signature look, embrace it!\r\n\r\nI've gone through a bunch of levels and I'll certainly do more. If anyone was looking to give mine a spin, here's the codes again:\r\n\r\nThe Spring's the Thing: F6DA-0000-0016-3AD4 \r\nBig Trouble: 3B43-0000-0016-FFC2 \r\nShell Shock (the TMNT one): 0CCD-0000-001D-9748 \r\nBuzzy's Cavern: D2D2-0000-0026-9161 \r\nMole Mountain: 2AB6-0000-002D-182F\r\nI'll play all yours now. Thanks for the feedback! I really like making things look nice, but I try even harder to make them play well. Which moles did you have a problem with? Maybe I should put a trampoline in the beginning? I put a mushroom at the start so people could tank it if need be.\r\n\t\t"

Gettin' the hang of this stage making thing. I really want you guys to try them and maybe hand me a few stars if you enjoy them. I focused on making them fun this time around... like really focused on it. I know it sounds obvious, but the other stages I made focused on being cool/challenging.  As always, I'll play and star all of your guys levels if you drop me a PM with the code. I'll even comment and give feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPacman Fever\r\n\r\n(8038-0000-0030-897D)\r\n\r\nThis is a minigame so don't think you can beat it the way you could a traditional Mario level. This is an homage to the father of gaming as we know it. Here's looking at you, Puckman. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoshi's Rad Racing Coaster\r\n\r\n (EAEC-0000-002F-DCD5)\r\n\r\nAlright now this one can be a bit tough, but it's not at all unfair. Yoshi's built a twin racing coaster in his basement. Think you can ride it all the way to end? Note: try not to be mad at Yoshi as he laughs at you from the safety of his operator's box. How many times have you used him to save yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteampunk Castle Crusade\r\n\r\n (E222-0000-0028-D662)\r\n\r\nThis one I designed to be a unique castle stage at the end of a near final world. It's steampunk styled, so its exterior is airship-like. When making this stage, I kept all that I knew about Nintendo's design philosophies in mind. I played it over and over, tweaking elements that didn't feel Nintendo enough. I'm happy with the end result, and I feel like it could easily blend in with the rest of the levels in New Super Mario Bros. U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, these next two stages I've posted before, but I never explained them the way I did with the new three. I will do just that and hopefully give more people the opportunity to play them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBowser's Heavy Metal Battalion\r\n\r\n (721B-0000-0025-1463)\r\n\r\nI absolutely love this stage. I wanted to make an autoscrolling level with unique boss encounters peppered in, but I also wanted to make sure the difficulty was just right... as I found the boss fight in my previous stage had caused most players to rage quit. What resulted was Bowser's Heavy Metal Battalion. It's a procession of tanks, each harder to beat than the one before it. It's got a good sense of speed, so I used Captain Falcon to convey that... and for the cool factor. The scrolling, the conveyor belts and the sawblade wheels give the illusion of moving vehicles. Kinda neat, huh?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssault on Goomba Factory\r\n\r\n(CF0E-0000-0022-6B6D)\r\n\r\nThis level was meant to be a self contained adventure story, told through sound effects. You start out outside of the factory, go inside the machine itself... see its horrors (transforming mushrooms into Goombas)... break the machine and gum up the works... then face off with the factory's malicious mastermind, Bowser, in an epic confrontation. After beating Bowser, you flee the exploding factory... just because I enjoy the cliche. It needs a little fine tuning, but it's still an awesome stage that I hope you see to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo yeah, those are five stages I think you guys will have a ton of fun playing. Like I said before, if you like em' feel free to toss me a star and even follow me. PM me a list of your stages and I will play and star every single one of them. \r\n\r\nThanks for playing. (If you do!)\r\nQuoting this for a new page. Haven't had any feedback on the Pacman level yet! Also, PM me some stages, I have all these stars and no one to give them to.\r\n\t\t"

I really think you're onto something with this as a sub-genre/stage type, but this doesn't feel like it should be the stage to introduce that notion. \nFor instance, the first area could have a floor and a way to get back up to the top and try again, like the rope swinging sections in Wind Waker allowing someone to fail without having to begin again. \n\nI feel like I'm well into \"special worlds\" in this stage, but maybe that's because this stage now comprises 90% of my Mario trampoline jumping time :)\n\nReally well thought out and executed.\r\n\t\t"

There are a few different routes to take to get some extra's, but how and why is up for you to figure out. You won't be throwing the controller at the screen from this level but still, it's no cakewalk either. Hopefully pretty balanced.\r\n\r\nInformation:\r\nName: Discovery Caves\r\nCode: 0DE2-0000-0031-6BD2\r\nBased on: Super Mario Bros.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad to really work to finish this one but well worth the effort !\r\n\t\t"

There are 3 hidden 1-Ups. When dealing with large thwomps, always use star protection.\nMiiverse link\nNintendolife link\nID is 3354-0000-002E-2B4C\n\n\nI don't know if many Youtubers are on GAF but if anyone does a video I'd be very happy to see it because I don't really have anyone who can test my levels for me! \nThanks for reading/playing, enjoy.\r\n\t\t"

Here's looking at you, Puckman. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoshi's Rad Racing Coaster\r\n\r\n (EAEC-0000-002F-DCD5)\r\n\r\nAlright now this one can be a bit tough, but it's not at all unfair. Yoshi's built a twin racing coaster in his basement. Think you can ride it all the way to end? Note: try not to be mad at Yoshi as he laughs at you from the safety of his operator's box. How many times have you used him to save yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteampunk Castle Crusade\r\n\r\n (E222-0000-0028-D662)\r\n\r\nThis one I designed to be a unique castle stage at the end of a near final world. It's steampunk styled, so its exterior is airship-like. When making this stage, I kept all that I knew about Nintendo's design philosophies in mind. I played it over and over, tweaking elements that didn't feel Nintendo enough. I'm happy with the end result, and I feel like it could easily blend in with the rest of the levels in New Super Mario Bros. U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, these next two stages I've posted before, but I never explained them the way I did with the new three. I will do just that and hopefully give more people the opportunity to play them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBowser's Heavy Metal Battalion\r\n\r\n (721B-0000-0025-1463)\r\n\r\nI absolutely love this stage. I wanted to make an autoscrolling level with unique boss encounters peppered in, but I also wanted to make sure the difficulty was just right... as I found the boss fight in my previous stage had caused most players to rage quit. What resulted was Bowser's Heavy Metal Battalion. It's a procession of tanks, each harder to beat than the one before it. It's got a good sense of speed, so I used Captain Falcon to convey that... and for the cool factor. The scrolling, the conveyor belts and the sawblade wheels give the illusion of moving vehicles. Kinda neat, huh?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssault on Goomba Factory\r\n\r\n(CF0E-0000-0022-6B6D)\r\n\r\nThis level was meant to be a self contained adventure story, told through sound effects. You start out outside of the factory, go inside the machine itself... see its horrors (transforming mushrooms into Goombas)... break the machine and gum up the works... then face off with the factory's malicious mastermind, Bowser, in an epic confrontation. After beating Bowser, you flee the exploding factory... just because I enjoy the cliche. It needs a little fine tuning, but it's still an awesome stage that I hope you see to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo yeah, those are five stages I think you guys will have a ton of fun playing. Like I said before, if you like em' feel free to toss me a star and even follow me. PM me a list of your stages and I will play and star every single one of them. \r\n\r\nThanks for playing. (If you do!)\r\n\r\nQuoting this one last time. I really want feedback on my Pac Man level. Has anyone played it that can give me some input? I need to know if it's too hard or too easy. Also, keep PMing me stages. The ones from GAF are brilliant. You guys deserve more credit than these dumb automatic stages that get high praise. God, I love this game but damn if the ranking system doesn't need a retooling.\r\n\t\t"

I hate you for putting those springs and fire piranha's plants at the end there. Fun level even if it did make me rage slightly. The only thing I could see as being an issue is during the Bullet Bill to red shell turtle jump. Need to be on the last block to trigger the Bill and some people might not figure that out. That cloud/spike section is a bitch as a big Mario since it's so easy to hit the sides. That's what makes it intense though. Fun wall jumping and a nice work against the Star timer to kill the plants too. Great work.\r\n\t\t"

I made the same mistake, it's easy to forget, but especially in an SMB1 underground, it can at least give something else to a level that can be a bland setting\r\n\r\nThe last platform of the first set of bob-ombs should only be one set. It's good that there's some run off area, but if you go too far to the right, it can set off the next lot and make the level impossible\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you jump too high off the last koopa and hit the platform late, the blades can go to the bottom too quick and make it impossible there\r\n\r\nAfter the pipe,that single blade should be on a different pattern to the saw hell coming down at you. Make in panicky, but not impossible if again you went to the right too fast.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I enjoyed it as I like a hard level, but those few things could make it click a lot better.\r\n\t\t"

Gettin' the hang of this stage making thing. I really want you guys to try them and maybe hand me a few stars if you enjoy them. I focused on making them fun this time around... like really focused on it. I know it sounds obvious, but the other stages I made focused on being cool/challenging.  As always, I'll play and star all of your guys levels if you drop me a PM with the code.

I also like that I can use my platforming skills.\nI find your levels so good that I can't really tell how you could improve them.

Well, I can't quite help myself with adding secrets, so it has the usual three hidden 1-Ups, and actually over 100 coins, too.\n\nAnyway, presenting my fifth:\nKoopa Heights\n\n4CF5-0000-002E-5063\nDescription: I wanted to do a Super Mario World style level. And I don't mean \"a level with SMW's tileset\". I mean a level that plays like a SMW level. This is that level. The only enemies are Red Koopas, and apart from the secrets, everything else is pure running, jumping, and timing. Mario at its purest. \nSecrets: Three 1-Up Mushrooms and a YoshiSo, anyone want to tell me how far off I am from a Super Mario World level here? I think I got pretty close... but I'm the creator, so I can't judge that. It should be beatable on the first go if you're careful. But there are a few tricky jumps, I'll admit.\r\nEchoing the sentiment - Great job!

The obstacles should be put where the spring is at the apex to be cleared, it would be way more intuitive and less frustrating. You should also put coins and some things to enterrtain the player. It's not thatyour level is hard, it's just boring. You do the same jumps again and again and if you fail you start all over again. You allso should put some breathing room between obstacles, it's very tiring to bounce all the time and the player is falling asleep whereas it should be on the edge of his seat.\r\n\r\nDeath shouldn't be the punishment too, you should put a system where you can go to the beginning of the section and try again without restarting the level.\r\n\t\t"

No one wants to play unstarted levels as theres no quality control, which is a catch 22. \r\n\r\nThe only real satisfaction I get is playing friends levels as it holds their personality so im already interested going in.

Half my fault and half peoples short attention span. I Have the original, which i think shows itself once you have a go and realise you cant make the jump without a star.

I just want that hint of excitement then im onto the next, as theres endless levels which I think is the biggest problem with the game. No one wants to play unstarted levels as theres no quality control, which is a catch 22. \r\n\r\nThe only real satisfaction I get is playing friends levels as it holds their personality so im already interested going in.

Sounds like you might have fixed a few things with the two I had (minor!) issues with! Still, I’ll give you my feedback that I put into notes last night:\nAndarro’s Plains (not in this quote!):  Solid! Good two-way route level. Definitely worth a play.\nAndarro’s Mansion: Not bad! Making a good ghost level must be hard with this game – the toolset doesn’t really give you many options. Still, you found a way. Really fun, and the time is just tight enough to give you some unnecessary stress. Maybe a bit too tricksy, specifically with where you get the spring block from.\nAndarro’s Castle: Close-to-lava fireballs at the start are unfun and unintuitive. I know the coins tell you where they go, but you have no time to react so it’s all about memorization, not skill. The P block gimmick was a bit lame in my book – bringing something across much of the stage is very un-Mario and very un-castle. Definite step down from the other two but you’ve got enough skill that I kept playing your levels, so that should say something!\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Robin64\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tTouch Buzzy, Get Dizzy\n5B1B-0000-0022-A0A8\n\r\nIf only this was done by an actual GAFfer I would say this is the best GAF level. Get this guy an account, if only so we can lay claim to this! Total must-play. Clever reference but also just an awesome stage.\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Belgian Dude\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIt's a stage that uses Donut Blocks and Piranha Plants - introduces the mechanics, develolps them, twists them and ends with a final test.\nFeedback would be much appreciated.\nDonut Mines\n4282-0000-0026-45AC\n\r\nThe bunched-up pipes are a neat look! I’m not a fan of the end-stage gimmick, it feels claustrophobic. I also don’t like that the subarea means you miss out on the fire flower – it shouldn’t be an either-or thing. Otherwise quite good! I’m a little confused that you’re both Canadian and also Belgian but if you keep the stage output up to this par, it’s all good!\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by UncleSporky\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tPipe-opolis\nBA66-0000-002A-4DB2\n\n\nI always loved world 7 of Mario 3, just the idea of a world so focused on pipes.  And it's just a neat aesthetic that's different from most Mario levels, with so much green.\r\nIt’s 1990 and there’s a new World 7 stage! The hidden area near the end was vintage SMB3. Very good stage, definitely one of the best I’ve played.

However, the twist is that this level has a \"story\" to tell. How you interpret it is up to you!\n\nThe Goomba: A Sad Tale of Madness. BDAB-0000-0033-2697\r\nMario had a plan - infiltrate Bowser's Goomba factory and stop him once in for all. He disguised as a Goomba and entered the factory. But what he saw wasn't a group of Goombas cheering and plotting Mario's demise. No - the poor Goombas, unaware of their destiny, lined up and ran towards Mario - their supposed enemy. However, blindly obeying Bowser - they lined up to their deaths, unable to jump over the lava pit.\n\nMario was a different story - disguised as a Goomba, he could still jump. He shook the feeling off and got into a pipe, disgusted at his giant statue serving as the cause of too many pointless deaths. Goombas were the enemy - but they blindly obeyed their leader disregarding their own lives. \n\nExiting the pipe - Mario found himself into a cemetery. Souls of lost Goombas were there. Had he began to lose his mind? Surely the impact of seeing a few mushrooms die wouldn't be that great. But Mario - as the only being able to jump and avoid death in that place, saw himself in the feet of the goomba. No matter how many times he took out his disguise, another one would soon appear and he would, once more, see himself as the chestnut he used to stomp without reason.Another pipe lead to their sleeping quarters - and, defenseless, hundreds of goombas were awoken from their sleep to plunge straight into their deaths - as Mario had accidentaly set off a switch. What had Bowser done all these years was much worse than he previously thought - he had to be stopped.\n\nEntering another room, Mario gets a mushroom. This mushroom, however, twists the perspective - even though Mario was giant, he sees the goombas with little Ms and mustaches. He sees the Goombas as Marios. He sees himself in the Goombas. He was also a victim of pointlessly obeying a goal. Just as the Goombas saw Mario as the enemy to be defeated - Mario saw the Goombas as the enemy. Wanting to defeat Bowser at all costs, Mario would throw himself into pointless quests and do anything to kill his foes. Mario was no longer a hero. He gets back to the room with the statue. Seeing himself as the monster he really was, and seeing the statue as a motivator for blind hate - Mario destroys the statue. And when the statue is destroyed - once again Mario can't help but see himself as a Goomba - the disguise he used to infiltrate the fortress now coming back to haunt him.\n\nHe reaches Bowser, as Goombas watch from heaven in their clouds. They were the true victims in all this. Simply mediators through which Bowser caused harm to Mario and Mario caused harm to Bowser. They would be created only to live pointless lives. Mario defeats Bowser - but the victory feels meaningless. Mario is just a big a monster as Bowser is. Defeated and with nothing but pain and suffering in mind, Mario blindly leaps to the same fate he had given his foe - for there was not a good side to the battle - only two equal evils.\r\n\t\t"

I'll eventually release an underground level, a cliff level, and obviously a castle in the same spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a huge NES Metroid fan, and I really wanted to make a NES Metroid world. Eventually, \"y cant metroid shoot?\" will feature four levels, each being about a NES Metroid section. I started designing Brinstar, but the locked tools made me finish and publish Tourian first, thanks to its focus on action. Obviously it has a Samus Aran power suit costume, but I focused a lot on visuals and atmosphere to recreate the oppression of Tourian, and also on gameplay, obviously, to make it work in the context of Super Mario Maker (fidelity always second after fun).\r\nSadly, I feel like these don't quite accomplish their goals as well - there's some really unintuitive jumps in the \"classic Mario\" stage (the triple-koopa near the end is particularly bad about lining up, and the \"trap\" jump that doesn't work if you are big Mario is a big put-off), and while the Metroid level is very atmospheric, the difficulty in dealing with all those huge Bloopers feels like it distracts from the atmosphere. Maybe cut down on the number of them. And remember, you don't have to put the mushrooms in blocks - they can be out in the world or even right above Mario at the start to change characters!\r\n\t\t"

Challenging but fun siege on Bowsers castle, definitely my best level yet but that's not saying much lol\n\n'Castle Siege'\n9911-0000-0033-EB5C\n\nGive me levels to play GAF!\r\nFOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY GET RID OF THE SPRINGS AND NOTE BLOCKS\n\nSeriously though, it's a great level. It just needs to be toned down a bit. I love difficult levels but this is just frustrating at times. I got to the very end on like my third try and then died an idiotic death. Now I'm on try...I don't know, like 60? I keep dying trying to jump below the thwomps on the music blocks. And if I don't die there, I die on the springs trying to catch the p-block. My new rule of thumb when making levels is: never make any part of the level dependent on jumping correctly off a spring/note block. It'll just annoy players.\n\nAnyway, the fact that I'm still trying despite the annoying note blocks tells you how much I like the level.\n\nEdit: also, you should give the player more than just a mushroom at the start. I guess a fireflower would make it too easy, so maybe a leaf.\r\n\t\t"

I've done four so far, take your pick:\n\nHead Hop Heights: 78DC-0000-0027-E2FF (Super Mario Bros skin, standard outdoors)\nManor Madness: 3509-0000-0028-38F8 (Super Mario World skin, ghost house)\nBowser's Airborne Artillery: 5450-0000-0032-C96F (Super Mario World skin, airship)\nMario Bros Arcade: Reloaded: 2D75-0000-0039-C672 (Super Mario Bros skin, underground)\n\nHead Hop is the first course I made, very straightforward and not difficult as long as your timing on the trampolines is good. Manor Madness is the course I made while everything was unlocking, so it's packed with absolutely everything and isn't particularly cohesive, though I enjoy it regardless - it'll be the first one I delete when I reach my upload limit, however, and will almost certainly edit it beforehand. The Bowser level is probably not ideal for you, even though (to my mind, anyway) it's the best designed and most technical of my four so far. It's quite long and moderately difficult, including a boss battle, so probably not ideal for a YouTube video where you presumably want to breeze through these things. Mario Bros Arcade is most likely the best of the four for your purposes, it's effectively a remix of the 1983 arcade game, using the same map repeated seven times with different scenery and enemies to mix things up and increase the challenge. I don't think it's terribly difficult.\r\n\t\t"

It's much more refined than the original pre-release design (judging by what I saw of it on video). It does run into one problem, though, which is that it's possible to get stuck when you pick up the Spiny Hat and wind up in a location where you break the otherwise unbreakable blocks in your escape route. This isn't an issue if you find the shortcut immediately after picking up the Spiny Hat, but it's an unfortunate blemish on what is otherwise a magnificent stage.\r\n\r\nBy far the best creation I've played so far, and I've been picky.\r\n\t\t"

I understand limiting is smart but, I got a bit cramped in my space due to the focus on flying in one area.\r\n\t\t"

Really like Super Luigi U with the 100 timer levels, so this is a long level with a time constraint. Also dont throw lots of useless enemies out at you like other designers. Have fun!\r\n\r\nNot for novices.\r\n\r\nWhoa...people like you need to be put in prison. :0\r\n\r\nThat was certainly challenging though---perhaps too much. I think maybe you shouldn't have the initial part rely on a power-up, one that's also hidden, and the placement of the first Hammer Bros. is pretty much sure to either hit you. That was actually the hardest part for me.\r\n\t\t"

There are some vertical sections where you need to jump back and forth as well as some full speed running sections to keep it varied and long enough.

Followed.\r\n\r\nOut of the couple I've played so far only real complaint is that a couple spots need a bit more spacing, like when you wall jump back up in Can you get out?, you should maybe but a little wider alcove where the door is or widen the passage. Same kinda thing in Koopa Express, the openings into the train were a little tight and the bigger bombs are a bit cramped in the area at the end.\r\n\t\t"

I would gladly appreciate any sort of feedback.\r\n\r\nShip Security Shells\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nID: CF6C-0000-0023-1B29\r\n\r\nIt's always surprising to see how much easier your own stages appear to yourself, whereas other players struggle at parts of your level that appear trivial at first. It's kinda hard for me to put myself into the role of a random player playing the level for the first time and to introduce the level mechanics in a \"fail-safe\" way.\r\nThe game actually recommended this one to me after playing one of my own levels, so I gave it whirl. First impression is that it's pretty awesome, a nice puzzle level, and some pretty sweet shell bounces. Easily Star-worthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have some things that could be improved. First of all, Cloud Blocks aren't solid, so Small Mario can bypass the puzzles by jumping through  the clouds. Secondly, Super Mario can spinjump and destroy yellow blocks, making it possible to just smash his way through the puzzle on top of the ship. But on the other hand, leaving things like that in on purpose to allow a sneaky player a faster option would be a fair choice, too. There is a certain satisfaction in thinking you're breaking things, even when it's an intended break.\r\n\r\nOh, and thank you for being a creator that uses Spike Traps appropriately. One or two in the right spots are plenty to discourage players from doing things. Well,  it's okay to spam them in underwater and Starman rush stages, I suppose.\r\n\t\t"

You have the tools there, in any case, answer on how to proceed in the following spoiler:\nTake a Galoomba to where the spring should be and use it to boost you up. The spring does not respawn if you re enter the room, but Galoombas do.\r\nQuoting this, looks like you put a lot of effort in it.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by The Technomancer\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAnother simple, if slightly tricky course.

In this level I restrict Mario/Shy Guy to less screen space, and make a straight, narrow level but have the player move in a constant zig-zag path. Even though it's underwater, I'm proud and think it's my best level so far in terms of pacing and object placement. I'm gonna guess around a 30% completion rate for this one. \r\n\r\nEnjoy, and thanks to all you guys who have been playing my levels! Also I may have fallen into the trap of doing alliterative titles, I couldn't resist.\r\n\t\t"

First impression is that it's pretty awesome, a nice puzzle level, and some pretty sweet shell bounces. Easily Star-worthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have some things that could be improved. First of all, Cloud Blocks aren't solid, so Small Mario can bypass the puzzles by jumping through  the clouds. Secondly, Super Mario can spinjump and destroy yellow blocks, making it possible to just smash his way through the puzzle on top of the ship. But on the other hand, leaving things like that in on purpose to allow a sneaky player a faster option would be a fair choice, too. There is a certain satisfaction in thinking you're breaking things, even when it's an intended break.\r\n\r\nOh, and thank you for being a creator that uses Spike Traps appropriately. One or two in the right spots are plenty to discourage players from doing things. Well,  it's okay to spam them in underwater and Starman rush stages, I suppose.\r\nThank you and all the others for the feedback, highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nI resorted to use the cloud blocks in the doors as a way to let big Mario pass through them as well without having to run-duck or hit multiple blocks. I'm aware that players could cheat their way through, but during my testing I found it difficult enough to not bother too much about it. Players who can consistently pull that off are free to do so : )\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for something different, I whipped up some sort of tutorial level in which I showcase several ways to utilize coins for when building your levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nTutorial&Tips: How to use Coins\r\nID: 19E6-0000-0035-E3B8\r\n\r\nWhile I don't think that GAF is the primary target group for such a resource (Your levels are way beyond those that I encounter randomly), it might give inspiration to some of you. Also, I would appreciate feedback and any important coin usages that I might have forgotten. I hope that maybe some random players will pick up a few hints for coin placements. : )\r\n\t\t"

There are five different paths with different themes that will all lead to a different route to the flag at the end. It's made to be pretty easy to beat and more of a sightseeing/discovery sort of thing, though two of the paths have some light puzzle elements. I tried to give each path an equal amount of love so if it has a fair amount of gameplay early, it probably has a short ending. The routes are relatively short and I crammed about everything I could into the main level and sublevel.\n\nPlease give it a go (or multiple) as there's lots to see.

I've got probably eight levels from the thread lined up to play but I'll definitely play more. Even if you're the type who thinks everyone's skipping your level, give me the code and I'll play.\n\nTwo conditions:\n\n1) No kaizo or automated stuff. Just don't.\n2) I graciously ask if I'm going to play your levels and give you feedback that you try a couple of mine. If you want to give feedback, stars, posts, shares, whatever, doesn't matter to me. Do what your heart compels you to do. Just get another pair of feet on my levels and I'm cool with it.\n\nHere's my stages:\n\nThe Spring's the Thing (just the basic tileset): F6DA-0000-0016-3AD4 \nBig Trouble: 3B43-0000-0016-FFC2 \nShell Shock (the TMNT homage level): 0CCD-0000-001D-9748 \nBuzzy's Cavern: D2D2-0000-0026-9161 \nMole Mountain: 2AB6-0000-002D-182F\nWiggler's Red-Hot Fortress: 92AB-0000-0032-4720\r\nThe Spring's the Thing: A nice first world-esque level that serves to teach the player a new mechanic.\nBig Trouble: I see what you were going for, but the layout of the level didn't do your idea justice. Some more bottmeless pits and platforming challenges would improve it IMO.\nShell Shock: I never played TMNT on the NES so the reference was lost on me. I felt the level was pretty boring.\nBuzzy's Cavern: I really enjoyed this one. What's funny is I ended up missing the entrance to the alternate path and took what you had intended to be the exit pipe into it. I then proceeded to use the cape to fly over everything back to the start of the area.\nWiggler's Red-Hot Fortress: I loved the alternate cape path and the main path was also enjoyable.\r\n\t\t"

If you don't manage to break the ceiling before the screen stops scrolling and then get hit, you can't reach the stars anymore and can't beat the level.\nAlso, on all my runs Bowser jumped on the springs and then came falling down again and got stuck in the lower level part under the warp pipe. It felt jarring seeing him in the sky right after that.\n\nI made a \"Bowser following you\"-level with slow scroll as well, so I know how hard it is to get him do what you want :)\n\nI would be very grateful for suggestions or comments.\nReposting:\n\nBowser's Underground Lair\n\nCode: 23A4-0000-0035-251E\nConcept: Bowser's following you through the level, but can't attack you directly at first.

But while running it opens up a bunch of possible jumping paths, without being obvious about it.

I recommend others do the same, if possible - seeing others play through your course gives a ton of insight!\r\n\r\nI'm planning on playing through some levels in this topic when I get the chance, and give out some well-deserved medals :)\r\n\t\t"

You allowed the player to tackle one segment at a time. You made good use of coins to show the player where to be or when to jump. I also like that your placement of platforms and enemies emphasized short hops rather than full length jumps like most levels do. It's a little more engaging to mix it up like that.\r\n\t\t"

I must have played this level a hundred times tweaking the difficulty. This is a spiritual successor of sorts to my previous level Bowser's Heavy Metal Battalion and by extension Assault on Goomba Factory (both of these and the rest of my other stages can be found HERE. ) \r\n\r\nBasically, I wanted to recreate the feel of Revenge of the Meta Knight as best as I could. Mario infilrates the ship. Bowser gets more and more desperate... ramping up the difficulty. It all culminates into the most epic boss fight I've been able to muster up thus far. I keep my enemy pool shallow, only varying upon the enemies I've used previously. All and all it feels pretty cohesive. I did my best with the length and the difficulty, while also trying to use the most of the 500 seconds to build tension. I put the most time and thought into this stage out of all my previous incarnations, so I would greatly appreciate if you guys would play it, give me some feedback and star it if you like it.\r\n\r\nI'll be more than happy to play and star your stages in return, simply PM me one and I'll conquer the whole lot of them.\r\nTo be honest, it looks like a lot of effort has gone into this, but I think some more signposting might be needed. Maybe I'm being dumb, but its not obvious to me where I'm supposed to go and what the effect of hitting certain switches might be. I think if you tune this aspect of it, it will be better. I can see too many people quitting before seeing what your level has to offer otherwise.\r\n\t\t"

I like to think I have a critical understanding of what makes platformers challenging yet rewarding, and have been painstakingly creating Super Meat Boy inspired levels with the quality you would expect from that title.

This time it is in SMB3 style and it is a skull themed ghost house mixed with underground sections (it is meant to be the houses basement). It has three hidden 1-Ups (quite well hidden imo) and enough power ups (some are hidden) to survive. The only cheap part is the end, but there is a fire flower hidden which makes it really hard to die there, Check it out. I'm looking forward to feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78BA-0000-0038-FCD3  (House of Skulls)\r\n\r\nI will also post two of my other levels again. The first one is my second newest and has got only three plays (nobody beat it until now) in it's first day. It is a SMW level that concentrates on the spinning mechanic. I tried to have a learning courve there with a mandatory use of spinning to even enter the level (also you get the information that destroying blocks with a spin is only possible with big Mario). This is followed by optional platforming sequences and finishes with mandatory in increasing difficulty. All in all I would rank it as a medium hard level.\r\n\r\n7B9D-0000-0032-0110  (spin and win (3 hidden 1 ups))\r\n\r\nas the level name already indicates, there are again three hidden 1-Up mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe last level I'm showing again in this post is my most pupular one, it is called Show your Flow. It is in NSMBU style and the timer lasts only 30 seconds (the intended clear time is 22 seconds on both routes, although it uses the longest possible length without warp pipes). The clear rate is 3,01%, but it is a really fair and based on comments fun challenge. So if you've got half a minute, check it out\r\n\r\n5321-0000-002E3989  (Show your Flow)\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to feedback for any of the levels.\r\n\t\t"

Something to do as a breather between the main feature. This one could have had optional flying challenges, maybe.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd rather end a level early than run an idea stale. I keep 100 Mario Challenge in mind for these, too.\r\nThat is a fair enough point, I'm just greedy.\r\n\t\t"

Mario infilrates the ship. Bowser gets more and more desperate... ramping up the difficulty. It all culminates into the most epic boss fight I've been able to muster up thus far. I keep my enemy pool shallow, only varying upon the enemies I've used previously. All and all it feels pretty cohesive. I did my best with the length and the difficulty, while also trying to use the most of the 500 seconds to build tension. I put the most time and thought into this stage out of all my previous incarnations, so I would greatly appreciate if you guys would play it, give me some feedback and star it if you like it.\r\n\r\nI'll be more than happy to play and star your stages in return, simply PM me one and I'll conquer the whole lot of them.\r\n\r\nReuploaded with more signage.

Help your friends escape!\r\n\r\nIt's a silly premise but I had some fun with it.\r\nThose poor, poor Goombas... what could they have done to deserve such treatment?  This one is almost traumatizing to go through. More of a visual story than a level outright, there's still a few bits that can kill you.  I think the escape could have been more dangerous without losing the concept, while still being enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Insidious_Walrus\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat's up GAF,\r\n\r\nYesterday I submitted for consideration my first level, \"Golden Cliffs\" (ID F41D-0000-001D-7020). I got tons of positive and useful feedback from you guys (I've almost hit 50 plays!) that I incorporated into the design of my second level:\r\n\r\nRuined Castle Romp\r\n6684-0000-0034-1BD7\r\n\r\nIt's considerably longer and more challenging than my previous course, and it has tons of secrets and shortcuts, including 4 secret 1-up 'shrooms. I've spent the past hour tweaking it, I hope you like it!\r\nThis one is already in the showcase, and I'll add my recommendation as well.  Defiinitely grab this one and play it, it's a lesson in solid exploration design with consistent visual elements and themes.  If I had one complaint, it's that the level encourages exploration so much, I found myself taking a couple leaps of faith into lava, just to see if I was missing something.  Perhaps make sure that off-limits areas are more clearly marked.  Excellent level overall!\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by KingBroly\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tHere is my Fourth level that I just uploaded.

I only checked one door on this level and avoided the others, as the first was a dead end, as far as I could tell.  The last section of boos is also a bit tedious with nothing to break it up or change the pattern.  I do love the theme of the level and would like to see something a bit more fleshed out.\r\n\r\nAnd now...  my turn!\r\n\r\nKamek's Kursed Killer Kourse\r\nB519-0000-0034-F467\r\n\r\nThis is an SMW Ghost House that borrows a concept from the 3rd castle in SMW, where Kameks magic makes for an unstable bridge.  Includes quite a bit of Ghost House trickery, including \"dead\" ends, surprises, and a deceptively difficult bit of platforming.  This is the level I've work on and refined the most thus far, so feedback is welcomed.  I would say this level is definitely on the hard end, without being unfair.\r\n\t\t"

Which proved itself to be quite the challenge.\r\n\r\nNot all rooms are mandatory to complete, some lead to the three 1up mushrooms hidden around, and one features an optional puzzle whose completion can make your life a bit easier later on.\r\nFun level with a neat use of bombs. I found one of the secret 1-ups. Only thing I disliked were those half covered pipes. I thought they were useable as small Mario and ended up losing my power-up for nothing... \r\n\r\nI liked how the level looks, with the small cramped rooms and the interconnectedness. Nice job!\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by ameleco\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOkay so after my Arwing level, I decided to revise my Dk's Jungle Climb level and have finished Dk's Jungle Climb 2.0. I put a lot of thought into how to activate ? blocks. Check it out and let me know what you think!\r\n\r\nFE8E-0000-0039-43CC\r\n\r\nEdit: Should mention this course is on the easier side of things (as all of my courses are after horrible completion %'s on my first few levels)\r\nSimple and fun! I got scared at first with the Thwomps but then realized they weren't my enemies. Silly Bowser Jr. started attacking me with fireballs and almost got me though. It was a tad short though. \r\n\r\nVisually it was fun although it could use more coins to grab, just for fun! The silly Koopa shell machine was cool too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Azure Dream\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tUnderground Mines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCF4E-0000-0039-3B94\r\n\r\nGAF will find this level super easy, but I was hoping to build something with character.\r\nLol I died at the beggining trying to see if there was anything below. Then died thinking the pipes were accesible haha. It was fun though. I feel like I missed many secrets (found the Leaf near the beggining though!).\r\n\r\nI liked the look of the level with the ice blocks although I wish there was more enemy variety.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nAs always, I'll link to my levels here, hoping somebody plays them (they have very little plays so far ;_;).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost...postcount=4749\r\n\t\t"

I tried to include enough variety and a couple of secrets to keep it interesting for experienced players, while also allowing several ways of getting past the main obstacles in case an inexperienced player was struggling. For instance, a line of coins indicates that you need to fly over a wall when you pick up the feather, but there's a P-Switch nearby which will turn it into a staircase as an alternate route. Similarly, if you fail to get over a tall pipe that requires a running jump, a lakitu will appear so you can climb on top of some nearby blocks and snatch his cloud.\n\nThe Beginner's Guide To Mario - F140-0000-0039-9D1B\n\nI also made some minor adjustments to my level based on the 1983 Mario Arcade game, smoothing out the difficulty pacing and get rid of two elements which could injure you slightly unfairly.\n\nNew code: Mario Arcade: Reloaded - 2D75-0000-0039-C672\n\nOTHER COURSES\n\nHead Hop Heights - 78DC-0000-0027-E2FF\nManor Madness - 3509-0000-0028-38F8\nBowser's Airborne Artillery - 5450-0000-0032-C96F\r\n\t\t"

First level in SMB Style.\r\n\r\nBasically this level started with me wanting to make some kind of up and down level, and I wanted to do something using springs, so I ended up with this. You use springs and vines to climb up and down the trees! There's a bunch of secrets and paths to take, as well as the usual 3 hidden 1-ups. There's also two sub-areas with secrets!\r\n\r\nLast segment is a nod to DKC3, with the saws coming up as you climb the tree. Probably could use some modifications but I ran out of blocks.\r\n\r\nWould love some feedback on this one.\r\n\r\nBarking Up The Wrong Tree\r\n9F8E-0000-0033-3240\r\nI played this yesterday, I really liked it and think it might be my favorite of yours. I'm a sucker for vines, they might be my favorite object/mechanic in Mario Maker.\r\n\r\nCan't really think of any major criticisms I had, though I did remember somehow getting hit twice to the by landing on chain chomp when you come out of a pipe around the middle of the level. Felt a bit cheap because you couldn't really see him until you landed on top/really close to him.\r\n\r\n I could be remembering it wrong though, I played a ton of levels yesterday.\r\n\t\t"

Some levels were quite long and with some deaths I had to leave out a few people. I am willing to do a longer video if people are interested. I think sending me your level via PM might be easier for me to collect for next time. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM7BG5rAmKo\r\ndat 50% success rate\n\nI kid, I kid. Thanks for doing this though, it was fun seeing the levels in motion. Would love for you to make it a series.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Gsnap\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThese are fun. I like the little twist ending for the Mines. Though I do feel like they could use a little more. There's a lot going on, but I really only did three or four things it feels like. I know that's a weird criticism. But looking at the overview picture I see there's a lot that I missed. So I guess these levels are best played through multiple times.\r\nYeah. Each path is pretty short, dunno if it was the right call to have 5 different paths instead of having fewer, more fleshed out ones. Which path did you take? \n\nThanks for playing them by the way. I'll give your course a run through in return as well. :)\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Gsnap\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWell, everyone. I finally found some time to finish my first real course. I think it turned out ok. It's probably a little on the easy side for everyone here, but I focused more on presentation than challenge for this level.\n\nTitle: Raiding Rocky's Air Ride\nStyle: Super Mario World: Airship\nDifficulty: Easy-Medium\nIdea: You've been tailing Rocky Wrench's airship for months, and you finally found them anchored high in the mountaintops. Board the ship and take back what they've stolen from you! (And of course you can steal some of their treasure as well)\nSecrets: Well you'll have to find those for yourself. : )\n\n98A3-0000-0038-2E02\n\nHope you guys like it. Constructive criticism is always welcome of course. I'll be looking through the recent pages and playing some levels, and I'll give my thoughts on them soon.\r\nThat was pretty fun! I'm assuming there are 4 different secret rooms? I was only able to find 2. Presentation is really great here. Felt just like a Mario airship level minus the autoscrolling, which was also nice. Gives you the time to take it all in without the frantic rush.\n\nEmbarrassed to admit that I died near the end thinking that clouds lead to another secret area and not the goal.\r\n\t\t"

I got tons of positive and useful feedback from you guys (I've almost hit 50 plays!) that I incorporated into the design of my second level:\r\nRuined Castle Romp\r\n6684-0000-0034-1BD7\r\nThis is in the showcase now so my praise may be a little late! Very strong level design with rewards for exploration, with one big exception: the hidden area above the final pipe leads to a lone coin that is essentially fatal because you can�t jump back after getting it. Don�t put a coin out there if I�m not meant to get it! Very good work, though � this level feels almost more like a Sonic or Bubsy level because the world feels very open, very airy. Visually this level might be a bit too busy but the design is solid.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Robin64\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMade a low to medium difficulty \"airship\" level.

There are tons of leaf powerups, so I guess you knew this. Everything felt restricting here. Neat concept, but I didn�t enjoy the execution. I have a rule of thumb for playtesting that I�ve mentioned before, that you should try to beat your level without powerups to make sure it�s airtight. No way this would pass that bar. This is so close to being a really neat stage, so don�t get discouraged here! You have an eye for the dramatic here, and that�s so important.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Jims\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust finished my first \"high concept\" level design.

Kinda Sonic CD'ish.  When I thought of that name, I threw in a Chrono Trigger \"cameo\" as well.  Was going for an intermediate challenge level.\r\nI don�t love concept levels, but this was fun! I�m a sucker for alternate dimension mechanics so I guess it was easy to make an exception for this � and this pulled off the mechanic well. One big pet peeve: vines shouldn�t be hard to get off of! I think because of cannon placement it was easier to do the vine jump in the bad future than in the good future. Definitely had a Sonic CD feel and I caught the Chrono Trigger bit at the end � subtle but appreciated. Well worth playing.\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by itschris\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI just made my second course, if anyone wants to check it out. Like my first course, I kept to a theme and tried to have a gradual ramp-up of difficulty.\r\nKoopa Paratroopa Land\r\nA397-0000-0034-680B\r\n\r\nNot bad, but it needs a little oomph. Enemy and jump placement seemed too easy, but you don�t have a huge clear ratio, so what do I know? Good fundamentals, but I wish something more was going on in the stage. Things never move beyond paratroopers, and there�s no payoff variation on the paratroopers. At the end of the day, Nintendo�s made paratrooper-heavy levels for 30 years so this just didn�t stand out. Only real surprise was the one that jumped out of the box. I guess you could say this level lacked drama. Add a dose of inspiration to your craftsmanship and you�d have a real winner.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Attleborotaco\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust finished making my 2nd level. Its a mario version of Bubble Man's Stage from Mega Man 2. Try it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nBubble Man\r\n1570-0000-0034-A4D4\r\nNeat interpretation � and we get to see Mega Man swim, and it�s so weird looking � but way too hard at points. Hammer Bros. standing in for the frogs at the beginning is just too mean given the tight jumps you have to make � you should�ve tried goombas or something else. The one-ups just appearing on their own is weird. The blooper-spike bit was tough but basically fair and highly reminiscent of the Mega Man 2 stage, so well done there.\r\nOn a personal note, it sucks you worked hard on this and Nintendo went and featured someone else�s Bubble Man stage today. Given that I busted my ass to get my TMNT dam stage out and someone else�s TMNT dam stage got featured, I know how that feels.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by tebunker\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAlso my stages in no particular order, I always appreciate feedback.\r\n7CD1-0000-034-A2B8 Long Ghost House\r\nB338-0000-002E-C7BE Lovingly titled, Bower Jr's a little ship\r\nB507-0000-0022-0E10\r\nO992-0000-0021-A1C2\r\n(In order) Not your parent�s  ghost house: There is a ton going on in this level, too much maybe. I got really far down the main path, turned around, went down that giant spiky coin hole and found the rest of the stage pretty easy from there. Jumps are well spaced, but the use of giant enemies doesn�t fit with the sort of mystery theme I associate with ghost houses. I felt hurried a lot here, whereas most of the time you�re supposed to go somewhat slow and think in ghost houses. Still, I think this was good.\r\nBowser Jr�s a little ship: Short and a little unfocused. I really don�t like levels that start you right under a powerup � give me room to stretch my legs and fetch it myself! You make the stage reach up vertically, but in practise that just means I bang my head against enemies who are above the screen and out of sight until I hit them.\r\nJr�s Fortress: Another one that�s way too short. Making the stage one and a half screens tall doesn�t give me options so much as it just makes me feel like I don�t know where to go. Good placement of firebars, but why are the firebars down low so dinky? They aren�t threatening so much as amusing. If that�s some sort of conceptual dig at Bowser Jr., I can get behind it.\r\nCan you jump it?: Tried the bottom route but it�s a total pain. Went up high and it was easy. You sure wish there were vertical levels in the game, hunh? Liked the level design once ti flattened out up top, but again it�s too short. My advice is to maybe spend some more time playtesting, attacking levels from every perspective the player will have, and try to pare down the choices the player makes into meaningful, interesting decisions.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kinsei\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI'd be grateful if you would do either one of the below courses.

Giant Bowser Jr. is a jerk. Dry Bones maybe come up too fast on the player. Mobile cannons are a fun idea. Just a real solid but hard airship stage, well worth playing.\r\nTwisted Trial of the Boo Buddies: Man, you just love those dry bones, don�t you? This is probably the best ghost house I�ve seen in the game yet. Title room is the highlight, but the rest is good too. Stage has a puzzle feel but maintains the needed linearity. Well done!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Ibuki\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI only have one stage I was confident enough to upload, I would be excited if you would try it and give feedback. I will start with your levels right now!\r\nTrial by Fire: 1029-0000-0034-8BC4\r\nThe way the fire bars and podobos match up, the only way to get by is through memorization. I used basically no skill to get through this level, just died everywhere until I found the right path through. Even at the beginning you can�t move freely because you�ll get killed by the first fire bar. Too short, too hard and you don�t get to enjoy moving Mario around the stage. The hidden area was a neat idea but it�s a huge hassle for a tiny reward. Ease off on the difficulty � that�s the first step!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by jepense\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tHaving unlocked the P-switch and World style, I made a P-switch dash level similar to NSMBU star-2 (I think), which was my favorite level in that game.\r\n\r\nName: Don't hesitate\r\nID: 3A76-0000-0034-2D14\r\n\r\nNot big on gimmicks but this one�s pretty straightforward � run to the next P block. It�s all about the execution, and this level has it. If you want a P Block chasing level, this is a must-play. Two criticisms: One, in SMW if you�re running you pick up P Blocks really easily, which makes the stage unnecessarily hard (not your fault, or course!) The other is that the very last stretch is probably a block too long � I had really good runs that fell just short, so it comes down to maybe a little too much memorization of the last bit. Still, very good! Some clever use of what�s available � if you stay big, it can help you spin jump to break some blocks. If you�re small, it means death. Good twist.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by jepense\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI made an airship level after having unlocked those tools.\r\n\r\nName: Cannonball cakewalk\r\nID: 04E2-0000-0029-5B29\r\nWord to the wise: Don�t put �cakewalk� in the title unless you mean it!

I've been frustrated that I haven't been able to create legitimate backgrounds.\r\n\r\nHere's my most revised tree-level. Looking for some feedback!\r\n\r\nTree of Genesis: 7679-0000-003A-83D3\r\n\r\nEDIT: Good stuff, bud! Dug the fact that it was more than one tree. Liked how underground it was as if you were trying to show bugs in the dirt. Nice ideas with the trampolines on belts, too. Found the bonus room and 2 1-ups, I believe.\r\n\t\t"

In terms of level design it's a fairly straight forward platforming level with a few enemies that are there just to be a pain in your backside.

I would make it a bit shorter for those not as good or else they would probably die somewhere in the second half and then decide to just skip.

In fact, I had some people over on Saturday and they all managed to complete it within two tries. I like the tension of many Koopa jumps in succession so that was my drive to create this one. There are some smaller puzzle-ish sections to break up all the jumping, as well as a quick cloud section that you can really use to make some quick progress if you're smart about it! :)\r\n\r\nID: 67C8-0000-001B-86BE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet Bill Bonanza!\r\n\r\nI'm shocked that there's only a 10.41% clear rate.

The beginning starts with some fire-based obstacles, I was quite inspired by DKC2 when making them. The trampoline section was an idea that popped up suddenly while I was working on the first section, and seeing as I had just unlocked doors, I figured I could get away with having multiple hooks to the level. When you get to the trampoline section, make sure you pay attention! Also, bring the first trampoline with you! That's why I added a 'Y' (I should probably put 'X', too!)\r\n\r\nID: DFA5-0000-0034-2544\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think of these!

It was pretty easy for me, but I consider myself really good at the NSMBU style. I would make it a bit shorter for those not as good or else they would probably die somewhere in the second half and then decide to just skip. For a stage only made with the default objects it's pretty good. I would have just trashed the section right after the fire flower where you go all the way down then up with the floating platform at the bottom. It didn't seem to have a point.\n\nI loves me some wall jumping. I've been thinking of ideas for a course based around it for a while now.\r\nI hear you.  I definitely didn't make the hardest wall jumping level ever, but since I don't have everything unlocked I figured I'd just stick to basics.  The section you're talking about was mostly meant to  \"teach\" that you need to slide down instead of falling in case there's no floor down below, but any veteran wall jumper would already know that :)  And I probably put it too late in the level to be a \"teaching\" item.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Solobbos\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tA nice challenge, sometimes I wasn't quite sure whether to drop forward or straight down.

I only made it through once while still big.\n\nThe other is the wall jumps almost immediately after that with the flying red koopa troopas to the right. The pipes you jump off of are a little small so there's a good chance you'll fall into the pit if you miss even one.\n\nYou can probably see where I died the most.\n\nI liked how it's almost like a Sonic level where there are multiple paths through it (high, medium, low), and different solutions based on what power ups you've retained.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind giving me some feedback on mine that would be amazing.\n\nMine's more of a puzzle one where you have to get a koopa troopa to the end of each section by knocking the blocks underneath it.\n\nKoopa Troopa's Bogus Journey\n\n1626-0000-003B-8120\r\nWow, thanks for the thoughtful feedback!  You're right, that section is pretty tough, especially because the Goombas keep coming.  It's probably too difficult for that section, but I think it would be good if I just removed the spawning goomba pipes and left the alternating pirahnas.  As far as the pipes go, I did try to make that part a bit tougher as it was getting near the end of the level, but I died myself there quite a bit.  Especially if you still have the super star running into that area, it's easy to go overboard and jump to your doom.  But you're totally right in calling it a difficulty spike, I never really was totally happy with that section.\n\nThank you for making the Sonic connection!  That was definitely an inspiration for me.  I tried to make most areas have at least two ways to get through it.  If you take the koopa shells around with you in the level there are a lot of shortcuts of varying trickiness that you can use.  I'll definitely explore that theme more in a later level, when I've unlocked more stuff.\n\nI'll definitely be checking out your level tomorrow :)  Thanks again!\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by VandalD\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThat was a fun level. Seemed like you could approach it in a lot of ways. I'd have appreciated it if less pipes were used as platforms if nothing was going to come out of them, but that's more of a general thing with me. I tend to stop before every pipe because the piranha plants in this game hate me.\r\nHahaha, I hear you.  Actually nearly every pipe had a pirahna plant in it at one time or another, and as I tested it I removed the ones that felt especially \"cheap.\"  You're right though, it does make you \"expect\" the pirahna plant.  I'll probably try to use that expectation in a more clever way in a later level, as it is you're right to point out that it's needlessly overused here.\r\n\t\t"

    "body": "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tLooks like everyone's been having a lot of fun with Super Mario Maker in here! I have been too, and I've come up with five courses so far, all of which I'm fairly to very proud of! I'm going to go through the thread and find some levels to play and provide feedback on, and I'd love it if ya'll did the same for me! Here they are, in order of creation:\n\nStep by Step... - 6583-0000-001B-F23D (The most amateurish of the bunch, since it's the first one I made. A pretty mild obstacle-course style level with some tricky platforming at the end.)\n\nThe Prince's Morning Swim - C265-0000-0027-A3FC (A short underwater level that emphasizes using stars well to get past otherwise-impossible sections. i'm rather proud of the very end segment....)\n\nFun with Super Leaves - 6305-0000-0036-BF85 (Me experimenting with the SMB 3 theme and making a course with a split route, only one of them leading to the goal.\n\nContra: Mario Corps - 1599-0000-0036-CE11 (A course which started as me seeing what kind of super-short level I could make using a scary face motif that evolved into so much more, eventually ending up as a run'n'gun-style showdown in a hive of Fire Piranha Plants. I really like this one!)\n\nBig Problem, POWerful Solution: CD31-0000-003B-80F8 (A super-short course with an obvious, fun gimmick and a somewhat less obvious way of actually reaching the goal.)\n\nI don't think any of them are all that tough, but they do have alarmingly low clear rates. They can be a bit tricky, sure, but nothing (I thought) a typical Mario/platformer veteran can't handle. If this game is teaching me anything, it's how incredibly bad many, many people are at Mario games.\n\nThat said, I'm not usually the creative type at all (I'm better at refining than creating) and I am floored by how much SMM is fostering my creative skills. It's truly emergent gameplay, the kind where you naturally learn and develop instincts, putting ever-larger pieces together over time. This is genuinely a brilliant game in many ways.\r\n\t\t"

Really addictive and super fun! Made my first level and it took quite some time to complete it. Before I knew it the clock said 4AM.\r\n\r\nIt's called Limited resources. I gave it some Metroidvania elements. You need specific upgrades to get to the next part of the level. There isn't much backtracking though. I gave it the name 'Limited resources' because I had limited tools to choose from (haven't unlocked everything yet) and the upgrades you need in this level are also very limited. Prepare for some trial and error. I made it very challenging. At least... I thought it was challenging as it took me quite some time to complete myself. Enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n5C34-0000-003A-70AF\r\nI like parts of this level and it had a good vibe, but the level is too cramped in places, which is funny considering your limited tools. Also, I got stuck at one point due to unlocking the spring on the spring, getting the fire flower then going back and one of the springs was gone. Make sure to thoroughly playtest your level! Otherwise, keep it up :)\r\n\t\t"

Very fun, fair, though a little random in places with no clear idea; I'm presuming there were two alternative paths? I went along the upper one if so. I think there could be more of a unifying idea. I liked the idea of the bullet bills on the moving platforms. Otherwise, pretty cool work!\r\n\t\t"

This isn't inherently problematic for me, but a lot of people are going to skip your level if they die a couple times in a row at the beginning (one of my levels has a similar hidden block trap and most deaths are there.)\r\n-As someone else said the first 1-up should just be a coin\r\n-The Mystery Shroom felt a little arbitrary, but a little whimsy never hurt anyone.\r\n-I'd put the Goomba's Shoe somewhere on the ground but where it can't kill itself, and replace the koopas with pirhana plants with just chompers like you'd expect in a goomba's shoe segment in a normal Mario game.\r\n-The Thwomps also felt a little out of place.\r\n\r\nOther than those things, the level is more playable than most that I get thrown into on 100 Marios. But the sky section is your biggest problem.\r\n\r\n-First of all, the vine at the beginning of the level is incredibly easy to find and lets you skip the entire ground section. What I would suggest is probably to just have some platforming to work your way up and left from the end of the ground area to some standard cloud-style platforms above, maybe some minor obstacles - no pitfalls to the ground - and a lakitu that you can get up to and steal his cloud. It might work even better if you could just put the cloud section in a sub-level. Maybe a vine at the end of the ground section leading to a pipe in the sky.\r\n\t\t"

I made a level with a similar concept but yours is much more of a traditional Mario experience.

I think I did decent work here, but of course I am always taking recommendations for improvement.\n\nIt originally was a level in the NSMU style with an emphasis on wall jumps. Since no one touched the level (No plays or views whatsoever), I modified it and I think it's most appropriate with an underground theme. \n\nPlease play it and give me a fair and honest critique. \n\n\nSubterranean Complex\n\n (87DE-0000-003B-947E)\r\nHrm, checked a few times to see if I was putting in the wrong code but couldn't get it to work.

However, after dying and coming back to the first section, it feels a little slow and counter intuitive. You first you need to go down and hit the blocks before making yourself small, so if you've already made yourself small before getting there, you have to make two trips. Ending felt a little strange as well, thought there'd be more big/small shenanigans. Otherwise, neat!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Dad\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLong Gone Mine\n666D-0000-0036-F091\r\nAnother great level and I think the first of yours I've played.

Also feel like I skipped a lot of the last quarter of the level, there was a mushroom there and some koopas that I couldn't figure out how to get to.\n\nBit of a slow burn but I still had fun with it.\n\nFeel free to play one of my levels if you so fancy.\r\n\t\t"

Did you look for the three 1Ups and the 100 coins?\r\n\r\nOut of your three courses I probably liked Koopa Paratroopa Land the best. It really feels like a Mario level.\r\n\r\nSaw Blades in the Sky looks a lot harder than it actually is, but in a good way. With lots of saw blades that actually can't hurt you.

The level is more gimmicky than the last couple I made since I was experimenting with the new stuff, but the theme of the level is if you would like to rescue a Yoshi or go without him, there are a couple little secrets and such laced around with not so subtle hints at times.\n\nFeel free to make any critiques or comments, haven't gotten a lot of attention on any of my stuff but, even if this wasn't my best level it was probably the hardest one to make, probably went through 3 versions before I settled on this one :P It's my Birthday so I might not spend much time tinkering with the game today but i've had a fun time making stuff.\n\n5653-0000-003D-B9C8\n\r\nNot a single person has tried my track above if anyone is willing to go for it. Also, to make this a not useless post, here is an additional level the more medium or above skilled might enjoy, simply titled Training Grounds. I was thinking of making multiple levels that focus on the basic mechanics and of course, the various items and such. I didn't have a bunch of great ideas or anything but it's fun enough. I tried to keep it short but sweet since I imagine people will die a bit.\n\nF166-0000-003E-B9E5 is the code if you'd like to give it a romp, appreciate any stars and such so I can hopefully upload more one day :)\r\n\t\t"

My suggestion would be to maybe add some coins or something up where the pipe with the P-switch is - there's a delay before the switch comes out of the pipe, and my first time through I tried going in the pipe then went back down when I couldn't, so I didn't see the switch come out. Maybe if there were a few coins to the right of the pipe I would have seen it while I was collecting them.\r\n\r\nI uploaded this course last night, but it got lost in the shuffle.

I think Shy Guy ate a few too many mushrooms at Club Star... \n\nHow do you unlock all of those awesome effects? Like the Dizzy Shroom and those 3 psychedelic bullet things that shoot past you near the end of the level? \n\nWell done man, that was awesome. Downloaded and starred\n\nEDIT: Realized the bullet things I was talking about are just multi colored giant mushrooms.\r\n\t\t"

I'm in the camp that's sick of seeing levels saturated with elements and no design sense whatsoever. I tried my best to play-test every section of each level to fine tune the challenge. I'm not sure if the clear rates for my levels are a good barometer of quality, but I know for sure they're possible and I hope also a little bit of fun!\r\n\r\nUndergrounded: FF4A-0000-002F-BBFB\r\nThis was my first course. I chose to go with the original SMB style and placed it in an underground setting. Some clever gaps will test your ability to nail those tricky running jumps and a couple of hidden 1-Ups are in there for those with an explorative eye!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUps, Downs and Bills: C3E3-0000-0033-B936\r\nMy first above ground level done in the NSMBU style.

This one is about skill and patience as the stage opens with some tricky jumps over open lava -- with jumping fireballs -- and the latter half is a tricky ride on a railed platform.

One of them was definitely worth playing though, a real diamond in the colossal pile of shit. It functions as an endless runner and is tough but very well balanced.

Captures that WarioWare feel and the execution is very good. Fans of the series have to give this a spin.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Robin64\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMy latest level.\n\nLight and Shadow\nC82E-0000-0038-7E5F\n\n\r\nBetween you and your buddy, I'm thinking there's something in that British water that encourages good level ideas. Another one that already got the big applause it deserves. I didn't love this as much as everyone else but there's no denying the craftsmanship.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Macheezmo\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSo I've noticed that most of my levels have like 5% clear rates.  I didn't think I was making levels that were really that hard, so I tried making one that was a lot easier, but still kinda fun to run through really fast.\n\n\n\nTitle: Goombas Take a Dive\nDifficulty: Easy\nDescription: Goombas everywhere are just walking off of cliffs like lemmings.  What crazy reason could they have for it?  Perhaps they just want to take a dip in the lake.\nSecrets: One hidden 1-up and a hidden door.\nCode: 0ADB-0000-003E-184B\r\nThis level however is getting nowhere near the attention it deserves. There's a bit of a blind jump in the first third (possibly self-referential?) but the rest of the design is solid and the big reveal is worth the playthrough alone. Was sort of hoping for a big payoff with about 50 goombas but that might have felt shoehorned in practice.

It may not be very obvious though, no one has cleared it yet :(.\r\nThere are some good concepts here, but it needs a lot of work to get it into a satisfying state. The shell launcher system to break out the flying thwomp broke on me once and got the shell stuck in an endless loop, forcing me to restart. Unless I did something daft, actually waiting for Thwomp to break the blocks is extremely tedious and creates some problems with the infinite koopa spawner. Even after clearing it, it's possible to fall into a pit below because of the blind jump down. The giant thwomp is impossible to see and actually ended up killing my run farthest into the course. Maybe stack the Thwomps to make them always visible while keeping the obstacle similar.\r\n\r\nSorry if I sound like a super negative asshole. I think there is a really fun idea with guiding the thwomp to dig holes for you, but the ideas need to be polished up to make a really great stage. Good luck!\r\n\t\t"

My best recommendation for that route would just be turn on ghosting in the editor mode and play around with the jumps to make sure they feel good. Lots of tiny, twitchy hopes don't play particularly well. Consider adding a Super Mushroom to the beginning of the level or else it will scare off most players from attempting multiple tries during the 100 Mario Challenge.\r\n\r\nI felt the harder route had much better flow and was overall more enjoyable to actually play. That said, I didn't actually complete, and that leads into one of my major concerns with the level. Reaching the hard route takes too long, requires making a limited jump off a Paratroopa to reach and has slow, bullshit crawling enemies on the stairs up. It makes repeated trips up there a turn off to players, which is a shame since its the more fun section of the level. Immediate access would feel much better, though I do like the gigantic prompt to warn inexperienced players. Also, the Super Mushroom is to the left of the fall into the hard area, which doesn't feel intuitive.\r\n\t\t"

If you get that far, you'll see what I mean.\r\nI didn't actually finish your course for the sake of getting to the other levels in a somewhat reasonable manner, but I can say a few things just from the beginning the area that I think would help encourage repeated attempts by players. That 1-UP mushroom in the beginning is easily outrunable for anybody that stats the level holding right, which I imagine most players would after an attempt or two. Having to stop to make sure you get the mushroom is a small annoyance that will become more frustrating with each repeated attempt during the 100 Mario Challenge. Secondly, music note blocks always felt very fickle to me in terms of precision platforming, so starting with two right off at the start is very discouraging since the bulk of runs will end immediately at the start.\r\n\t\t"

I'm by no means an expert at platformers and I'm able to beat it fairly consistently, though obviously I created it so I know all the ins and outs.\r\n\r\nFor my first level I wanted to create something where Mario has to indirectly interact with an object to reach the end, slightly more puzzle-oriented.\r\n\r\nI decided on having to guide a koopa troopa through a level so you could use its shell to break a brick wall at the end of each segment, with increasing difficulty as you progress through the level.\r\n\r\nYou play as small Mario so you don't break bricks when you hit them, but instead you can bump the koopa troopa over to the next platform.\r\n\r\nI chose the original Super Mario Bros. theme specifically so that you can't pick up the shell.\r\n\r\nIf anyone bothers to check this out, please let me know what you think, which aspects could be improved. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, I haven't had a chance to play test this with anyone else.\r\nOkay, I played this one.  Congrats on making one of the most frustrating levels XD\r\nStill, I was absolutely determined to beat it, up until what I presume (hope) is the end.  I got the koopa shell all the way towards the end, got the star, and simply raced across the plants.  Of course there's a block waiting for me, and I need the damn shell.  Of course, I have no more stars since that block only spits out one and then it's used, so I said \"fuck it\" because by then I felt like I could do it, but it was going to be too annoying to do.\r\n\r\nI really loved the slow, methodical aspect of it, and you did a great job of introducing mechanics and then ramping them up.  You just need to avoid having situations where you get stuck at the end because that's the most frustrating thing of all!\r\n\t\t"

Now a few critiques. The secret vine block is kind of a pain to get to, and I'm guessing your intended method was to knock the red Paratroopa down and run off the mushroom onto the platform. Maybe add coins to make this more apparent, as I saw an awful lot of red X's down below (including my own recently added). Also, consider ditching the Bloopers in the water section, they're a nightmare to deal with if you don't have the cape power up, and it's plenty challenging enough with the hordes of Goombas.\r\n\t\t"

The dungeon crawl is a fun concept, and I of course went with my boy Ike. Work on making the combat scenarios a little more interesting or offering different rewards for going at them different ways. For example the coins don't make for a particularly more enticing rewards for going through the harder upper route of the Monty Moles. Also work on making the aesthetic of the stage more interesting, since a most of the stage just uses boring looking flat structures like square and rectangles. It should look like a dungeon proper!\r\n\t\t"

The asymmetrical and sporadic architecture genuinely make it feel like a dilapidated place. It's a really easy stage, and I only have a few minor things to say in regards to feedback. The first Goomba spawns as soon as you start the level and has a weird time for when it falls of the ledge because of that. Maybe move it farther back to accommodate players that are observing the level for the first time. The angry wiggler at the end is kind of lame if that was supposed to be the Big Bad or whatever.

Hopefully that one works as intended, no one's played it yet though. I almost called it \"follow the signs\" because I don't want people to die, but I think it's so ingrained in our nature to go after coins that despite the title and the hint, people will probably get tripped up until they realize what's up. Hopefully the super obvious first couple of traps will alarm people to think puzzle style instead of standard platforming style.\n\nNeither level is the typical enemy-gauntlet die-on-the-first screen kind of carnage, and I took a lot of care playing through them multiple times.

(Implemented my own version of a check point!) Whereas the secret exit requires more timing and training.\r\nFun level! Nice idea for the checkpoint, I may steal it haha. First section felt way harder than the second one. Dodging those giant fireballs can be very tricky depending on when you take the rollercoaster.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nAny feedback on any of my levels is very appreciated: http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost...postcount=4749 .\r\n\t\t"

It's just a concept level - no tricky platforming. After revisiting it a few times post-upload, I'm wondering if I could have done more with the idea, or if the concise nature of the level works for the gimmick.\r\n\r\nF0FE-0000-0034-410E\r\n\r\nA couple of tips:\r\n\r\n1. Don't press anything in the first area until you reach the door\r\n2. If you're unable to leave the hockey arena, explore the home team's goal net\r\nIt's a fun, short, novel idea and you're probably going to get a lot of stars for it. The error sound playing when I destroyed the home crowd was a hilarious touch. Exiting the arena is definitely not intuitive and I probably would have just quit out of the stage without finishing. Despite the fun concept, it's short and not played up to any considerable degree, so there really isn't much to say about it.\r\n\t\t"

I know it's going to hurt your aesthetic, but the Drybones really just make poor enemies for bouncing off of due to the random nature of their bone throws. It can force you to wait and throw off other elements of the level. The circle Boos early on dysnced because of this and made it impossible to progress past them without taking a hit. I would also strongly advise adding another Super Mushroom in the Bowser room just before the series of spike jumps. Bowser's patterns can be really bullshit, and if he does the upwards fire shot, you're almost guaranteed to be taking a hit. Also consider extending the beginning platform. There isn't a lot of room to grab the mushroom as it is now, and it's easily to lose it off the cliff. Again, sorry for not making much more progress in your level. I hope you find the limited feedback useful!\r\n\t\t"

A puzzle-based level that has you trying to escape a mansion as Wario by solving the puzzle of the mansion. Pretty proud of this one. Its creation was fueled by whiskey.\r\n\"Wario's Mystery Mansion\"\r\n\r\n5984-0000-003F-1AA7\r\n\r\nIt really did feel like a Wario Land stage, which if that's what you're aiming for, is really cool! There were a couple things I didn't particularly like with the stage though. The time on the first P-Switch is really strict, with couple with how frustrating the jumps are up the hidden block ledges, can be really annoying and require multiple attempts. Maybe use vines instead of hidden blocks to alleviate the problem. Also, when you take the wrong pipe and come out on the roof, it's hard to identify a way down without possibly hurling yourself off a cliff. A coin trail could help players figure out how to get down without killing themselves.\r\n\t\t"

The level design is really good; I like how it gently curves up, down, left, and right.  It's a good flow and use of space.  The hazards were creative, like the combination of Thwomps and Piranha Plants.\r\n\r\nCheck out my level 3936-0000-0031-C411 and tell me what you think.

Now a few critiques. The secret vine block is kind of a pain to get to, and I'm guessing your intended method was to knock the red Paratroopa down and run off the mushroom onto the platform. Maybe add coins to make this more apparent, as I saw an awful lot of red X's down below (including my own recently added). Also, consider ditching the Bloopers in the water section, they're a nightmare to deal with if you don't have the cape power up, and it's plenty challenging enough with the hordes of Goombas.\r\nThanks for the feedback!  So I made a couple edits to the course taking yours and jholmes feedback into account.  I added some coins to make the path to the vine block more obvious, some to guide you on the blind leap, and a few others to sort of point out a route for speedrunning (there are a few routes that work). I removed the first blooper and put a cheep cheep there.  I left the second blooper in since his job is to make you want to go up.  I also moved the feather underwater to a slightly safer spot.  You can actually jump on the goombas underwater and grab them to kill the blooper if you need to. \r\n\r\nIt pained me a little to delete my most popular course just to fix a few things, but I'm happier with the course overall now.\r\n\r\nTake two!\r\n\r\n\r\nGoombas Take a Dive\r\nA4AA-0000-0040-2512\r\n\r\nUnrelated note:  I was happy to see this comment on one of my other levels.\r\n\t\t"

Again. :P\n\n7812-0000-0040-48A8\n\n\n\nPlease do! 7812-0000-0040-48A8\r\nFirst area feels a bit bland - I know it's only to hold the pipe(s), but it still should have a little bit more flair. After that I take the first donut down and get to the mushroom area and (another visual nitpick), nothing below the pipe doesn't look very pretty.\n\nI reached the underwater area and my first suggestion is to avoid 2-block gaps in the walls. It's really kinda difficult to swim through as big Mario. With the fire flower I killed the spiny (I suppose that's the spiny helmet but I couldn't put it on my head, and throwing it up would make it land with the spikes towards me).\n\nCheckpoint was a terrific idea but then the exit pipe towards the end of the level was there and I didn't find Yoshi yet. (I think it'd be better if you made it obligatory having Yoshi - or at least tie some of the puzzle segments to most of the level). That did intrigue me so I started over looking for invisible blocks and such. Using the Koopa Shell to get the feather was pretty great.\n\nBut I was stuck (I am a bit bad in Mario, there's that, but the average player is more) after that - didn't find any obvious places to fly (and testing the spiky helmet that was mentioned made me lose the cape before testing that right by the goal, and there are no refills from what I could see, which would force me to restart the level to find Yoshi). If the Spiky Helmet you mentioned is not the one in the underwater area (it seems a bit complex to be) then I'd remove the Spiny near the P-Switch Pipe entirely as it doesn't seem to serve any purpose.\n\nDespite all that, though, from what I could play, it was still a really solid puzzle in its segments and I had a lot of fun - there's just some points that can be a bit misleading for players that just discovered the Spiny Helmet mechanic (or those who saw there was something regarding that) and I think you need to tie the goal of Finding Yoshi more towards the level itself, otherwise half of it (and from what I could tell, an even better half) is hidden outside the main path with really no obvious reward.\r\n\t\t"

It's a great way of introducing a player to a mechanic without feeling hand-holding. I'd add a couple bricks to the bottom as well so we'd see a bomb destroying bricks but that's already really really good.\r\n\r\nCoins on top of the fireballs seem to serve no purpose but they allow you to see the thwomps above (and that they fall when you're below them) - it sets up the segment further up without overwhelming. However - you do have 8 kinds of enemies by the first two challenges, which I don't think is a good idea even in harder courses - you have to readjust your expectations - the fire spouter over the cannon is also not really that visible which makes things harder than needed. I'd raise the ceiling one in the thwomp section as well but that's because I'm really bad at games.\r\n\r\nThose are my notes from what I can see. I don't know when Boo circles start spinning but I had different experiences in that section because one of the two elements is timed. If there is an element of randomness there it makes it really hard (harder than I think intended) to hit the boxes over there.\r\n \r\nWill go around and come back to The Pass Less Taken.\r\n\t\t"

Love the way the mechanic is introduced, love the way the mechanic is developed, and the little twist at the end with the platforms. My complaints are pretty simple - the mushroom (the one I found at least) feels TOO far away into the level. Right after you can get a fire flower, and right after it's the end. I'd space them out more evenly even if it'd mean reworking the level to allow big Mario to pass through some spots. Either that or just give you a fire-flower a bit before where the Mushroom currently is and skip the Mushroom entirely.\n\nAnother problem I have is with one-block water gaps - I know it was a bit needed (small mario only for the 1-up, and I did manage to reach it) but it makes for movement (most of the time) rather uncomfortable. When it's right by a ceiling or floor is okay, but not otherwise. You did pretty good in that regard - but it makes a bit of a hassle going back from the 1-up and in other spots.\n\nIn water though - Mario doesn't stay in one block even if you keep mashing A. His foot reaches the tile right below - the part with bullet bills and spikes (really well introduced) loses a bit of impact when you die because of that and have to slowly go along the floor in your following turn.\n\nBesides Mushroom placement and the 1-block gaps this is really, really well done and really well paced regarding difficulty - doesn't feel too overwhelming but still really tense at times. I think I'm gonna recommend this to the community showcase.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Stoze\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tDay 3: Shy Guy's Spikey Swim\n9C9C-0000-0035-E544\n\nOnce I have some time in a couple days I'll give you some feedback in return (though I think I've played almost all your levels already and overall think they're great).\r\nWhat's with these underwater levels nowadays that I'm actually liking? You guys are besting Ninty in that regard, heh. (It's the lack of Bloopers thank you so much). Anyway - it's a really fast-paced solid level. It doesn't force you to keep moving but the way it's tightly designed makes you keep moving forwards, as well as the increase of bullet bills shooting fish and the placement of the coins. I do like the way you make us pick the mushroom at first. My 'problems' are really the fact that the fish don't really pose the biggest threat (they are really slow off the cannon) and each segment drags on for longer than it should. I think shorter segments (with maybe one or more two segments later on improving on the challenge later on) would be better and make the whole thing feel even more fast-paced (and fun) than it is.\n\nSo yeah - really solid stage. Didn't wow me mechanically but it was still really fun to play and my 'issues' would imo really just add more to it instead of fixing something. Great job.\n\nI don't know why you picked Shy Guy though (level itself seems to lack an explicit theme to the character) but HOLY SHIT YOU CAN COMMENT IN LEVELS YOURSELF? I need to update Waluigi Parable with the voice of the narrator stat for those that have comments on. O-O\r\n\t\t"

Considering every time I tried to stray from the main path I was punished it doesn't really work - despite being a cool twist, it will still lead to moments that feel kinda cheap. \nAlright - your other one was better - this one has a few Dry Bones issues:\n1. Dry Bones right in the start quickly goes to below the blocks if you don't run right away. That'd be fine - but the timing makes that he will raise a bone just as he's getting out, and you'll probably be falling down to try to kill him.\n\n2. The Dry Bones after the first main jump (in the raised platform) will absolutely kill you if you hit the block. The Boo Circle shouldn't really kill you in its surprise, but the Dry Bones will when you go to the top of the block to be safe.\n\nBesides that, I'm not the biggest fan of the Donut Climb to the room of death. That was pretty cheap - and I'm not sure if you intended, but after I got the cape (nice job on the clocks pointing out the cape though) and entered the pipe getting below the goal, I could just spin jump and spin the rotating blocks, so I just slid and got to goal. I think I probably needed to do something more there.\n\nBonus area right near the end of the level and with a lot of repeats isn't exactly all that enticing and precision platforming is never really super fun. Your other level is really way better - even if this one was fun in some ways.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by FrostuTheNinja\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWow, thanks for the nice write-up and tips. Yeah, tried to do the whole, \"stolen arms\" type of thing with the giant enemies and such, but the second airship being too big confirms my fears. But man, are the broken ship pieces at the end a great idea. Maybe I'll clean it up a bit more with your sentiments in mind. Again, thanks for the playthrough!\r\nNot a problem! But yeah, I always try to do that (it's a bit stolen from those analysis videos but I find it works for me as well) - end the level with either a callback to the level mechanic or to its theme. It really wraps things up nicely. Going for your other one now!\nE: Actually I got stuff to do - but one thing - the pipe at the top-left corner of the map leads to a sub-area, and in that sub-area it's super easy for the yellow platforms to de-sync, never letting you through. Use different lengthed tracks there and your problem should be solved.\r\n\t\t"

It has some neat hidden secrets.\r\nThwomps hitting moving platforms is a weird concept to base a level around, but you nailed it. You know how to introduce it, put a spin on it and take it up to another difficulty level. It also doesn't feel tacked on -- you take time away from the thwomps, so when the player gets back to them, it's significant. However, at the one point just before the end you have thwomps, and podobos, and bullet bills, and fire bars. It's just too much to time all at once. Otherwise very good job -- I just wish the game let us have more control over moving platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by ohNOitsRO\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tTried designing a vine scrolling level!

There's a part in the first bit with the vine grip where three sawblades converge on Mario if you go up. It's OK to let the player find two solutions to a problem! I also couldn't get past the second part without tanking a hit. If it weren't for the difficulty issue I'd have given this a big ol' star and told the world about it. I loved how you jerry-rigged the vine to pop at the start of the stage, it was hilarious. I laughed every time.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I did beat it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kriken\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSo I have this idea but something about it is just not right, would appreciate feedback on thism8-bit Pop Star recreation stage\r\n\r\nI'D 21C0-0000-0040-53FA\r\n\r\n\r\n‎\r\n\r\nThe first half just seemed too empty and wayyyy too close to the ground. The second half with the cannons was more fun. Loved the mini-boss room, though! At the end of the day I think Kirby doesn't translate one-to-one into Mario. If you made a stage a little more inspired by Kirby, taking the highlights from this level, I think you'd have something great.\r\n\t\t"

A little less than halfway judging by the map, where I \"trusted the coins\" downward onto a platform that quickly dropped me to death before I could see the upcoming situation. It's a bit too hard. It may not seem like it to you since you know the hazards, but the map very quickly changes pacing. It goes from running max speed with a flutter jump (on the first jump!) and then full speed off a second one onto the skull raft where you're supposed to hit a dead stop. Doesn't feel intuitive. Plus on that raft the fireballs were hitting me every time. I can only imagine it stays that hard throughout so I lost interest but gave it a fair shot.\r\nThanks, will definitely spend more time on refining it then.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nI edited the level, removed and added some things, including some you mentioned, and re-uploaded it, here it is in case you'd like to try it out again:\r\n\r\nEF7B-0000-0040-BE85\r\n\t\t"

Remember, pick a helmet up and then press down to wear it.\r\n\r\nNow the bad news, seems like the game has a bit of a problem when picking up new helmets from the ground, sometimes Mario will kick it instead of picking it up and it basically screws you over, so be careful and try not to run towards it.\r\n\r\nFor some reason small Mario is less likely to kick it, as long as you hold y and down running towards it as small Mario he will instantly wear it.\r\nThis was tough. It took me a few times to figure out how to escape after I killed the two dragons, The POW is out of place, it's not really useful in killing the dragon. Kicking the shells instead of wearing the shells is the most effective way to kill the dragon. Figure out a way to stop from throwing the shells to kill the dragon, and get rid of the fireball pipes in the fight. There are enough things flying around that the fire pipes just takes away from paying attention to the dragons.\r\n\r\nTo escape, I had to figure out how to grab the P, throw it up in a place where it wouldn't block my way up, then hope i can grab it again, to use it. It didn't feel intended, it felt a little wonky. I think if you adjust the stage so the spring will launch you to the top and maybe put the P in an empty slot halfway up to grab on the way up it'd be better. Or just put the P above where the Dragons are circling. These are just my suggestions though. It is a cool idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by AniHawk\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tnew level. i really like verticality in platformers, so i tried making one where that was the main concept. originally, it was smw with a ground theme, but i changed it since the background was messing with the illusion too much.\r\nSolid idea and pretty well executed. It was a fun stage. I had a little trouble figuring out if I needed the boot or not, but it became pretty clear that I needed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Diggeh\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tFinished a new level! Mario's fallen asleep on the job, and it's up to you to wake him up! Help him escape from his dreams while avoiding strange things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's fun making levels that are thematic over Kaizo levels of unfair platforming.\r\nI've seen a couple of these dream state mario stages now. It's a cool concept. Stage was interesting, not difficult, but I had to take it slow as I had no idea what to expect. I would suggest, instead of a door that leads to a pitfall, make the door lead back to the beginning or something. That way it is more inception vs. loss. You are keeping them in the dream\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Rizzi\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI made a level that I feel is decent-ish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetey's Plateau.\r\n\r\n32C6-0000-0040-CAAA\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be too challenging. A bit more complex than my other ones so far. Looking forward to unlocking more tools to play with.\r\nPretty short stage, but pretty cool classic idea. You were pretty liberal with your use of the mushrooms. I suggest making it unnecessary for so many mushrooms by creating ways where people wont need them as much? Not sure how you keep the theme and help people keep the mushroom they just got, but that's my suggestion.\r\n\t\t"

Please give my level a go guys. \r\n\r\n0E3C-0000-003F-227D\r\nI gave you a star and a win, but I can tell you what's wrong. The level is rushed as it is because of the P-Switches, and the difficulty ramps up as you go. I died the first time I got to the tower of enemies that requires the goomba bounce, I died a couple times on the koopa bouncing, I died by being a fraction of a second too slow and the P-Switch ending after the giant chompers, I died twice to the fire spitting pirhana, I died the first time I got to the donut block. Once I got past that I had to take a leap of faith off the flagpole to the pipe I didn't know was there, and then I had to go through the underground section twice because the first time I hit the P-Switch too soon and had to get by Bowser then try again.\r\n\r\nThe level isn't really aesthetically pleasing except the underground section. It felt like a lot of memorization and If I had run across the level in 100 Mario mode I would've skipped it after the third death or so.\r\n\r\nNot saying the level is bad, just pointing out what I think are the negative points, but I'm not sure I would exactly call it completely fair either. Trial-and-error levels will usually get skipped if they aren't really short.\r\n\t\t"

The P blocks certainly didn't help the situation. I also wasn't really given an indication of what was to come next so it was difficult to adapt with all previous stuff I mentioned. I had to memorize the level to a certain degree so I could get through it at a decent enough pace. I tried it about 40 times before I could beat it. I had to face against Bowser 3 times before I realized I had to wait for him to get in the right spot then press the button. I was in such a rush because of the overall pace of the level that I didn't really register that I had time to chill and deal with Bowser more strategically. In between those 3 times with bowser I was struggling to not fall off the block on the rail. Most other people won't want to have to memorize a level to beat it. The level was fun, but from a game design 101 perspective it was lacking.\r\n\t\t"

What if the goombas and galoombas Bowser employs are actually just mushrooms that have been chopped up in some kind of factory?\r\nI just played your level, the idea is neat, but it has some flaws...There are too many things going on, so sometimes it�s difficult to know exactly where you have to go. I understand the intent of making it look like a busy factory, but you need to keep those things away from the player�s path unless he can use them. The level is quite short, you could expand it and use more area to show everything more clearly.\nGet rid of the sound effect in the Goombas.\nThere were some points where I got killed the first time and I couldn�t do anything about it: once after taking the conveyor belt it launched me into the springs and a Goomba fell on me. There were so many things there I couldn�t understand if I had to use the springs to go up, the conveyor to go left or what...Also, once I left the moving platform a Goomba killed me from below from what should�ve been a safe position, you should adjust that a little.\nThe cloud at the end doesn�t add anything, it felt totally out of place.\nThe arrow at the end pointing away from the goal..why did you put that there? I tried following it once with the cloud but, again, couldn�t find a clear path or anything the arrow was reffering to. The arrow was pointing me away from the goal so I was awaiting a big surprise and was disapointed when I couldn�t find anything worth it.\n\r\nDon�t get me wrong, it�s not a bad level (if I sound harsh please excuse me as English isn�t my main language; it�s not my intention). I think the idea behind it is really cool and I love how you used Bowser, it�s the first time I�ve seen him been used in a cool way: he is a menace and you must pay attention to him, but he�s manageable while you navigate around the level. He helps keep the tension up.\r\n\r\nHope my comments help :)\r\n\t\t"

It took an idea and built and expanded upon it pretty well.\r\n\r\nI do have some issues though.\r\nMaking it so the player can die almost instantly at the beginning if they don't react fast enough, is seriously obnoxious. \r\nThere's quite a few blind jumps, try throwing some coins down to show the intended routes do \r\nAnd the amiibo Mario thing was mostly just fiddly to do\r\n\r\nStill, as far as first attempts go, this is one of the better ones\r\n\t\t"

It has been a while since they played a Mario game, so I'm sticking to very simple ideas and designs before introducing harder challenges (I may have to make a jump easier for one level now that I think about it). I'm trying to make levels with a similar progression to what one could expect from a classic Mario game. It is also interesting to replay a few SMB3 levels and see that almost none of them require the player to actually run to get past obstacles.\n\nIf you want to take a look, here they are (all SMB3 levels, 2 ground level, 1 underwater, all very easy):Level \"1-1 Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆\":315C-0000-003E-363A\nLevel \"1-2 Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆\":EC10-0000-003E-FEC1\nLevel \"1-3 Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆\":BD2B-0000-0041-DAEC\n\nLittle list of changes I would like added to the game:One nice addition to SMM would be to add the Boomerang bros (from SMB3). The current Hammer bros don't have an alternate form, and it would be a perfect fit for them (not to mention they are far easier to deal with than the Hammer bros).\nAnother nice change would be to be able to make 2x2 \"background\" blocks. Right now their minimal size is 3x3, preventing some creative opportunities.\nI already mentioned it earlier, but for underwater levels it would be great if we could make pipes which push away the player with their bubbles.\nCheckpoints: some longer levels really could use them, and alleviate some frustration from dying.\nSlopes of course.\nBe able to put some Water in some above the ground levels.\n\r\n\t\t"

It has a optional subsection, which is quite hard. Would also like some feedback regarding this (playing with and without subsection).\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\n\nBowser's Final Stand\n5D1A-0000-0041-3F26\n\nThis is a new one. I tried several ways to include bosses. The sections in between the boss fights are okay, I guess. Since it's quite long the level is probably harder than it should be. Feedback appriciated.\r\n\r\n\t\t"

This thread moves so fast that it's tough to discuss this sort of thing for any length of time, so I compiled everything I wanted to talk about together as well as I could.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about posting it to reddit.  What do you guys think?  I don't know if it's like...the best advice, or if it's all self-evident anyway.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1...it?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThe opening comic is the single greatest piece of advice I can offer:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very good advice, and anybody interested in making quality mario levels should read this. Obviously you don't have to follow these rules completely. If you really believe something you're doing is good for your level, even if it conflicts with these rules, do it. Also I suggest everyone read the tips in Mario Maker's digital manual.\r\n\r\nAnd anybody really serious about making good levels should watch these videos:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmIkEvEBtA\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0c5Le1vGp4\r\n\r\nAnd read this series of blog posts on Mario and game design in general (specifically Course 101 - Foundation � though the rest of it is really good as well, this stuff actually applies to Mario)\r\n\r\nhttp://critical-gaming.com/gamedesign101/\r\n\r\nHere's my first real level: 98A3-0000-0038-2E02\r\n\r\nIt think it's pretty solid for a first attempt. Difficulty comes from enemy placement and optional challenges in order to find secrets, with the only really tight plaforming needed at the end to get to the goal (and even that isn't the most difficult platforming). But, even though I think it's pretty good, I've already noticed some things I want to change about it. There's these Rocky Wrenches that are guarding coins like it's their treasure. And I like this, it fits with the theme of the level, and it encourages risky play to get the coins. However, when I had my wife play the level, she had more trouble with the enemies than I had anticipated because she had a lot of trouble seeing them behind the coins. That's not what I wanted. I wanted the act of getting the coins to be miniature challenges, but I didn't want the player to be blindsided. I wanted them to know the enemy was there, and actively choose to fight them. So I'm probably going to re-upload the level and remove the coins that are in the same tile as the Rocky Wrenches, and just leave the coins that are to the left and right of them, hopefully making them more easily visible, while still adhering to the theme and offering a mini-challenge.\r\n\t\t"

Also got a lot of crap so that may have just been luck or wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nControversial opinion: The cap for creating your own levels needs to be tougher. It would force you to craft the best levels possible instead of just posting your amiibo collection as a level or other stuff that is just testing grounds. My cap of levels went to 20 when I only had 8 made, but I think my stars would be higher if I had more players try what I've had (my star/player ratio is pretty good). \r\n\r\nControversial opinion 2: Each time you complete a 100 Mario challenge, it should give YOUR levels priority to be played by others. It keeps you involved, participating in the playing and feedback process that way.\r\n\r\nOh, and I made a new castle level. It's actually easy (hopefully) but it has a lot of stuff going on for a bit of an adrenaline rush. Just run fast.\r\n\r\nMario & Luigi Go To White Castle\r\n(2349-0000-0040-E142)\r\n\t\t"

I would love for y'all to check it out and let me know what you think! \n\nI'll go ahead and post all the stages I've created thus far, starting with my most recent. I'll streamline this post as much as possible.\n\nAeroskies\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\nStage ID: 17D1-0000-0040-D11A\nThis stage took work, a LOT of work. With a heavy focus on exploration yet familiar linearity; not every missed jump is a missed opportunity, so look for those secrets!\r\nKelp Assembly!\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\nStage ID: B281-0000-003A-FB76\nA linear pipe foreshadows your route as you make your way through this autoscrolling water stage. Despite the implied pace, don't panic; just keep swimming!\r\nTrial Caverns\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\nStage ID: 273C-0000-002F-B77A\nDeep in Mushroom Kingdom you'll find this cave at the base of a towering mountain. Venture if you dare...for what awaits, are perilous drops, tricky platforms, and some persistent enemies. Make sure you pace yourself before proceeding along the pipe walkway!\r\nWhat Goes Up...!\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\nStage ID: 777C-0000-002E-4B15\n...must come down, or so they say! This stage will have you doing both as you make your way across this canyon of pipes and tight platforming! Watch out for that last step, it's a doozy!\r\nI really hope you guys enjoy these stages. I've been steadily unlocking materials as I create, so I've been taking a slow and steady approach. I enjoy it though, because that means I can test my creativity with what's currently available. Every stage is not without it's secrets, but I don't believe in spoilers, so have fun!\r\n\t\t"

I liked how most areas had multiple ways of reaching them, though I'm not sure all of them are intended. Especially the way I finally solved the level.\r\nGot the first mushroom, ran far enough to the left to see the feather spawn, followed it down and took the hit from the big Thwomp to get it, which kinda ignored most areas. \r\nI thought the way you have to get the Yoshi is a bit unfair, since you can't really see it when kicking the shell. You can also jump that row of flowers with a spin jump if you're small. And if you reach the left area without a feather (and you're small), you have to kill yourself, maybe a one-way exit back into the level would help there.\r\nBut anyway, I really liked the level, looking everywhere for the exit was a lot of fun.

There are 5 distinct areas: ground, sky, outside the ship, inside the ship, and the captain's deck. It's probably too difficult for the average player, but I tried to at least keep the difficulty to precision platforming and not bullshit trolls. You can either see or react to pretty much everything that's coming.\r\nI'm late to the party here, but if you have time, could you give my Boo's Inverted Haunt a spin (or ten)?\r\n\r\nBoo's Inverted Haunt\r\nDBF8-0000-0042-2E51\r\n\r\nSeems like people like it quite a lot.

There are 5 distinct areas: ground, sky, outside the ship, inside the ship, and the captain's deck. It's probably too difficult for the average player, but I tried to at least keep the difficulty to precision platforming and not bullshit trolls. You can either see or react to pretty much everything that's coming.\r\nReally good level. It's challenging but never unfair... well apart from one little bit.\r\n\r\nIf you miss the pipe to enter the airship you do land safely on some clouds for a second chance. However, having a second go on the blue platform will prove a lot harder the second time as now the canon has had a chance to shoot multiple spinies since you have to wait for the blue platform to return whereas the first time across you only need to contend with one.\r\n\t\t"

Things move so quickly here that every time I load up the game I can only get through a handful from the last few pages.\n\nUnrelatedly, I had my first run-in with the censor today: tried to save a stage as \"Yoshi test\" and was informed it wouldn't fly. Surely they wouldn't block \"Yoshi\"? (Turns out they blocked \"shi t\".)\r\nSuper fun and challenging, was getting frustrated with all the thomps. till i found the helmet.. then lost it instantly cause i had to make a jump under a thowmp and lost it cause it was too low.. my only complaint really other wise it was a fantastic stage, hard but not unfair. except the thwomp thing..\r\n\t\t"

It had everything: nice pacing, varying platforming, making you think where to go next...Also, few different elements used, but combined in many ways ramping up complexity as the level advanced. It really felt like it had been taken out of SMW, big congrats to you, what an inspiring work :)\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by PSqueak\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLegit one of the best freaking maps in this thread and the game itself.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Hasney\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tYeah, I'm going to go along with that.

The best level I've played so far. Not really hard, but the gameplay, holy shit.\r\nThank you everyone. I's awesome to see the level so well received. And yes, it is exactly as much work as it seems. Sadly, you cannot copy from main to sub stage, and even if you could, you can't rotate a multi-selection. The only way to do this is to break out some squared paper and draw out the level, block by block, and the draw it again upside-down in-game.\r\n\r\nOne free tip for anyone who's mad enough to try the same concept: Flip the Gamepad and draw upside down. You can draw as if you were drawing a normal level like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Nocturnowl\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tBut it was worth it, I'm impressed you pulled it off, I'm sure I'd go mad trying to lay out the logistics of it if I dared to tackle such an idea myself.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by kinggroin\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMcNum, you're insane. The work that went in to making sure rotated ares still play well. Damn.\r\nI feel like these two quotes answer each other.

It was great to see that yes, most of the subtle details I did to lead the player do work, except for one where you hesitated. Sorry about that, I couldn't find a better way that a line of coins into a blind drop there, hoping that you've been conditioned to trust my coin placement by then. It worked, but it could have worked better. Maybe next level I'll avoid a blind drop like that.\r\n\r\nOh, and for those who didn't find the three hidden 1-Ups, here's a hint: Look in the same ?

I remember that crossing my mind at some point while designing but just forgot about it after the Nth test play.\r\n\r\nSecond point: I actually had 2 adjacent donut blocks here originally, but that actually made it more of a hassle because you couldn't guarantee that they'd spawn adjacently. It made it look like a mess. I might redo that part later. If not changing the donut block, then maybe making the jump to the pipe shorter or less obstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by BGBW\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tReally good level. It's challenging but never unfair... well apart from one little bit.\r\n\r\nIf you miss the pipe to enter the airship you do land safely on some clouds for a second chance. However, having a second go on the blue platform will prove a lot harder the second time as now the canon has had a chance to shoot multiple spinies since you have to wait for the blue platform to return whereas the first time across you only need to contend with one.\r\nYou can use the previous pipe to exit and reset the room. Not an elegant solution, I'll admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Pinky\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSadly, I'll be at work for a few more hours, so I'll miss the live streams.

The only overall thing I'd change about yours is maybe making a makeshift \"checkpoint\" system: replace the lava with an actual floor that leads backward to a door that in turn puts you back at the start of the current room. That way there's no \"lava death -> restart whole stage\" factor to deal with. Maybe put in more mushrooms so that it doesn't take just one hit on a buzzsaw to end the whole run, either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by ElectricBlanketFire\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tYou did a great job being so composed during my level (The Black Lodge).\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nQualty Stage Design�\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for rage and reaction mugshots, you'll need to bother some other Youtuber. :P\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Jobbs\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nD4: The Dave Identity 1DE0-0000-0043-6437\r\n\r\nThe fourth installment of the acclaimed series Spiky Dave has officially gone live on Mario Maker.

I'll be checking back in this thread regularly to get more new courses to play and hopefully some helpful feedback.\r\nAlright level, no real challenge and navigating the various passageways felt constricted and overly controlled. I didn't feel as though I was interacting with much of the level so much as just following it to the end, though the multiple paths alleviate this slightly. Could do with a few more enemies and a bit more freedom for the player. No outright problems per se, just lacked any spark.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kiro\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\n\nName:Thwomp Mines\nTileset: SMW/Caves\nDifficulty: 5/10\nCode: C77F-0000-0042-3484\n\nWould really love some people to try this out.

Let me know what you think :) there are tons of secrets in this level too!\r\nReally enjoyed this, it was well-designed, moderately challenging and the placement of the first subworld pipe is appreciably fiendish - I found it when I completely mistimed a jump. There's one instance of a thwomp falling from off-screen above, but you signpost it with the blocks on the ground, so not really a problem, even if it could maybe be refined. The ending with multiple dry bones jumps was great. Nicely done, even if I wouldn't call it 'brutally' hard. Moderate difficulty (World 4 or 5 level) at most.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Jupiter_Shrooms\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI've made a course themed around pushing and shoving wiggler's riding clown cars.

Started out really enjoyable, the mini-maze to hit the P-Block was neat and not too difficult to work out what needed to be done. Unfortunately, five boss fights is ridiculously over the top, especially considering the relative lack of decent power-ups (put one before Bowser Jr Fight 2 - the Thwomp jumping section is fair, but difficult). Had the level ended after Bowser Jr Fight 3, I'd have been perfectly happy. Instead it went on and on, and by the time I died after the fourth Bowser Jr fight (in the clownship), I gave up out of frustration, making this the only level I didn't complete. I like the idea you used for the last Bowser fight (I looked at it on the map), but there definitely shouldn't be more than three boss fights total. Also, the red cannon firing the koopas in Bowser Jr 3 killed me more times than Bowser Jr, which got old very quickly indeed as it fires right into the middle of the arena, where you're most likely to be standing given the gaps in the floor and nature of BowJu's attacks. The idea behind the level is great, but it needs some serious cutting (and I say that as someone who makes long levels myself). My advice would be to prevent the player from ending Battle 1 prematurely with the star, then go to Battle 4, then Bowser. Maybe make the Thwomp jump section a little easier too, since in a level this long, the idea (for me, anyway) should be to demand a consistently solid level of performance from the player without throwing big spikes at them. Love the idea, execution needs work.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by KittenMaster\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI need more people to play this level and test it out. I am thinking about making an easier version of it (that counts as a separate level) but I want to see more people try to complete it first to see if that is the right decision.\r\nI'm not sure you need to make this a lot easier, but right now it is more frustrating than fun. It's a good technical challenge, but you could, for instance, lower the second jump to be less demanding (the trampolines are fiddly to begin with) and maybe have a few more moderately difficult challenges thereafter. The one with the rising platforms and the moles is a good example of a fair, well executed challenge based around the level's core ideas. Having to try the same jump over and over again because you always hit half an inch below the top of the platform you were aiming for gets irritating quickly. As I said, decent technical challenge, but not exactly enjoyable in its present state.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by vgamer1\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThis will be my second level, GoombaZone.com.\n\n\n\nPretty simple level, goomba themed. Getting used to the mechanics of the game. Would love some feedback!\n\nB3E3-0000-0042-5499\r\nGood, solid level. Not too difficult, about the right length, never unfair. I liked the goombas completing the staircase at the end. No particularly strong notes, either positive or negative, but a perfectly functional level with a decent amount of variety for its short-ish length.\r\n\t\t"

It is called \"A day at the mushroom zoo\"\n\nIt is my first level with Lakitus and there for it can be hard because of the randomness of these. I had the idea to make it a fair level through putting the player in somehow the creators perspective. This is archieved by showing the player any harm (enemies, spikes) a lot of time before they can be harmful in a theme and story compatible way. There are enough Mushrooms to beat it, but normally it will take a few tries. Of course there are three hidden 1 ups for an extra challenge.\n\n\nThs is also my first level with somewhat a story told through the level.

There are 5 distinct areas: ground, sky, outside the ship, inside the ship, and the captain's deck. It's probably too difficult for the average player, but I tried to at least keep the difficulty to precision platforming and not bullshit trolls. You can either see or react to pretty much everything that's coming.\r\nChallenging right from the start. Chain Chomp in a tiny island is mean. Tricky jumps in the first section. It was fun though. Second section is fun though, although it features entirely different hazards. Track section with the flying spiny shell is also mean. I didn't finish the level. I'm sorry. It was fun and challenging but involved way too much waiting with the moving platforms and enemies you have to dodge so replaying after every death (which could happen anywhere because there's lots of pits) got tedious. It'd be a great level if we had checkpoints though. The jump to the pipe to board the ship is very bullshitty though. Making it a falling platform is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Jobbs\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nD4: The Dave Identity 1DE0-0000-0043-6437\r\n\r\nThe fourth installment of the acclaimed series Spiky Dave has officially gone live on Mario Maker. This new map is packed with classic Spiky Dave gameplay along with some new twists. Can you at last discover Dave's secret? Follow the clues. Things aren't always what they seem...\r\n\r\nThe Spiky Dave series, known for its challenging but fair, risk and reward gameplay, originally launched in September 2015 and has since garnered cumulatively over 20 stars and numerous awards. Play it today.\r\n\r\nChallenge: Find Dave, and kill him. Both are possible to do, and will require skill and resourcefulness. The only hint I'll give is that you'll know when you've found him.\r\nThe description is just too good for me to avoid trying this. Holy crap almost died right at the start with those pipes with Goombas. Then I died at the section in your GIF haha. How did you pull that off?! Lol at the boss. Very annoying but that shout in pain FX always cracks me up. Pipes with fire is a nice idea and not as challenging as it looks. Nice hidden secret in the first section, makes the level lots easier. I found Dave but didn't kill him. He seemed so happy. Very fun level, FX made me laugh and it was charming.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nShameless advertising of my levels\r\n\t\t"

But that didn't work out quite as I had hoped it would. So instead I thought \"Okay, why not make a sort of boss rush?\" In retrospect, I think I overdid it quite a bit. If it were only the bosses that would be one thing, but since there is a small section between each bosses (and some are indeed quite hard, like the Thwomp one). The thing with the cannon annoyed me also, but they had to spawn/land on the middle platfom because of the holes in the ground. Also, since I made 5 fights I had to make them different enough to feel fresh. The very first at the beginning didn't even had Koopas, you had to lure Bowser Jr. to the blocks so he would break them. Then I realized if you didn't manage to do that you had to restart.\n\nI may just split this whole thing in half, and make two stages instead of this big one. One could end with the second or third boss battle, the other one start in the section right after that.\r\nTwo levels would definitely be better. I enjoyed each segment independently, but after a while it becomes exasperating, especially when you die and have to do it all over again. I played it quite a few times, which should tell you that there's a lot of merit in what you have done, there's just too much of it.\n\nMy levels again in case anyone feels like giving them a try.\n\nA Beginner's Guide To Mario\nTheme: Super Mario World, Overworld\nDifficulty: Very Easy\nDescription: My attempt at a 1-1 style level intended to teach newcomers the basic skills required for a Mario game, with enough secrets to keep more experienced players entertained.\nCode: F140-0000-0039-9D1B\n\nHead Hop Heights\nTheme: Super Mario Bros, Overworld\nDifficulty: Easy\nDescription: My first attempt at level creation, a straightforward level whose challenge revolves around short segments bouncing off trampolines and koopa heads. Collect all 35 coins if you can find them!\nCode: 78DC-0000-0027-E2FF\n\nManor Madness\nTheme: Super Mario World, Ghost House\nDifficulty: Medium\nDescription: I built this as I unlocked new tools, so it's sort of a fustercluck and has just about everything in it. Will probably delete it once I hit my upload limit, but it's fun in a bonkers sort of way. No cohesion, but a lot of variety and one well-hidden sub-area (and a secret Yoshi).\nCode: 3509-0000-0028-38F8\n\nMario Bros Arcade: Reloaded\nTheme: Super Mario Bros, Underground\nDifficulty: Medium\nDescription: A series of short challenges based on variations of the map from the 1983 Super Mario Bros arcade game. Hint: In the arena with the red wigglers and fireballs, there's a hidden block in the usual spot above the ground floor (the same place the POW is on the first and second arenas, etc). I really should have made it visible as the level's too hard if you don't know it's there.\nCode: 2D74-0000-0039-C672\n\n\nBowser's Airborne Artillery\nTheme: Super Mario World, Airship\nDifficulty: Medium-Hard\nDescription: This is a long, so far unbeaten level, whose challenge comes from maintaining a consistent level of performance throughout. There's no trolling or kaizo stuff. Find the secret fire flower to help you a ton (there's a clue in the thumbnail) and there's an epic shortcut that cuts out the Bowser fight entirely. Quite proud of this one, even though no-one seems able to beat it. Will you be the first? (Advice: Take it slow and steady)\nCode: EB50-0000-003F-002F\n\nBowser's Undersea Artillery\nTheme: New Super Mario Bros U, Underwater\nDifficulty: Medium\nDescription: It's a sequel to Airborne Artillery! Once Bowser was taken down in that level, his airship sank to the bottom of the ocean. Now Mario's returning to it, diving for treasure. Same essential map layout - a good way of learning what lies ahead in the more difficult Airborne level - only with the change from overground to underwater giving the challenges a new twist. I really like the attention to detail in this one, play it and Airborne as a twosome. An invisible 1up block is hidden in the same place in both.\nCode: EB50-0000-003F-002F\r\n\t\t"

Very nice level!\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Big One\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMade a new level.  Up & Down Town\r\n\r\n6D3D-0000-0044-6AFA\r\nThis level was good, but it definitely could've benefited from a few coins to point out the way.  Not that it was confusing, but anytime you're descending it always felt a bit blind.  The layout was good though.  Some fun wall jumps and the two doors at the top of that climb was cool, thought I ended up on the left side, I'll probably go back to see what's in the door on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by 2SeeKU\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tHere's my latest Zelda inspired level: \r\n\r\n\r\nCool level!  It wasn't too difficult, though it turns out if the trampolines knock you up faster than the koopa shell, you get hit and end up above the shell without the blocks broken and are completely stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Gotdatmoney\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tBridges & Boos\r\n46C2-0000-0044-75A0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew level ready for Critique. Spent a lot of time on this one and really happy with the result. Let me know what you all think, feedback would be great. Went with a Super Mario World ghost theme. Tried to keep it as Authentic as possible so its almost purely ghosts (small exception). Would love gaf forever if some of you tried it.\r\nI had a lot of fun with this.  It was challenging but not unfair.  It feels like a good mid-late game level.  I like the multiple paths.  I think I found 3 1-UPs in the stage.  Well done!\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Wyndstryker\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWindy Canyon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9070-0000-0044-720D\r\n\r\nTried to make this something like a World 2 to 4 difficulty level.\r\nVery authentic feeling!  This really felt like it belonged in the game.  The enemy placement and coin placement and everything felt just right.  This is a really great level!\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, I think that's enough for tonight.  I'll try to play a few every day, which I know can't even begin to cover all the levels that get posted.\r\n\t\t"

Lots of people are going to stumble on that very first koopa-block and by now, that may put them off of even trying out the rest of the stage. It's not immediately apparent that backtracking with the springboard is the best way to proceed in the middle of the level.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, I thought that the secret path to the fire flower was handled very well and rewards those who understand the differences in how the NSMB theme controls. Overall I'd say it's a good start for not having a ton of tools available yet, but there are a few tweaks that could really help with the level's flow.\r\n\t\t"

I suppose it could be possible to have a pipe that spawns stars instead of a question block. Then the only non-renewable part of the stage would be if you accidentally get a coin with the p-switch section.\n\nI tried to make it so that it was impossible to miss the invisible blocks, that there's always a little block you have to jump over and when you do that you hit one of them.\n\nBut yeah, I looked at the results of a few people playing the level and almost everyone died before getting through the first barrier.\n\nSo I did an updated, streamlined version:\n\n3E84-000-003F-720A\n\nThis one removes the higher blocks that required you to be running to get enough height to hit, and it adds a very basic initial segment that shows the player how to use a koopa shell to progress.\r\nI tried your level again.  Got stuck again, this time because the koopa got turned around and by that point I'd used the star.  I'd have been able to salvage it with another star, but alas.  Still, overall it's MUCH better.  I had more fun with it this time.  It definitely feels more polished.\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by McNum\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tPresenting my ninth:Boo's Inverted Haunt\n\nDBF8-0000-0042-2E51\nDescription: A ghost house level with a gimmick.

If you want the stage to be easy avoid putting 1 block wide jumps withs Koopas :P\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed 4 but the concept is better suited to checkpoints. Dying makes you go back so far. The secrets you hid were clever. The first room was really visually cluttered. Made it hard to see. The room where you have to throw the bob omb up is also visually cluttered.

I've been working on yours, and it flows quite well like the vertical stages in NSMB, although I'm still figuring out the final pipe; I've been getting there consistently since the first attempt but managing the timing and height of the donut block seems a smidgen tight, especially as I keep bumping my head on those deceptive airship tiles surrounding the pipe entrance. Still chipping away at it, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by CloakBass\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\ttwitch.tv/mugenmidget\r\n\r\nStreaming right now!

Well...\r\n\r\nPresenting my ninth:Boo's Inverted Haunt\r\n\r\nDBF8-0000-0042-2E51\r\nDescription: A ghost house level with a gimmick. When you enter a Warp Pipe, the level spins 180 degrees. To go right, you must go left. Stand on top on one platform, then walk across the bottom of it shortly after. And finally make your way past spinning saws and moving platforms.\r\nSecrets: Three 1-up Mushrooms. All hidden in the exact same manner.This one took a lot of time to do. Mapping out an exact copy of the main world in the sub world is time consuming, especially when it's flipped 180. Not to mention route planning since some parts of the map has to work both ways up. Pencil and paper was required. I really hope you guys like it, I doubt I'll do another one this crazy any time soon...\r\nVery nice! I had a similar level in the works before I saw this, but finished it only now. Yeah, it took a lot of tinkering to get both sides of the level work...\r\n\r\n\r\nName: Super Mario Galaxy 3\r\nTileset: SMB3 airship\r\nID: FA15-0000-0044-8A76\r\nDescription: This is a puzzle level, so it should be a ghost house. But the gimmick is gravity switching, so I liked the sky/industrial airship theme more as a nod to Mario Galaxy. There are some stage hazards, and you are on a flying ship, so there is definitely an element of danger here, but none of the traps actively come and get you, so you can take your time to find the right path.\r\nSecrets: Three 1-up Mushrooms. There are a couple of junctions where the incorrect path leads to a 1-up as a consolation.\r\n\t\t"

I love the leaf, and SMB3 in general, so yeah I wanted to make something that used it right away. The first Bowser is sorta meant to be a trick...it can be a shortcut, but it's also risky. I suppose a warning would have been a good idea though. The sub area is also just kinda meant to extend the level a little, and me experimenting some more.\n\n\nI just played through your Ghost House stage, and I thought it wasn't bad. I love the SMW theme also, so I dunno if I like your stage, or it's just the nostalgia kicking in lol. That being said, I do think there may have been a few too many ghost circles. Not that they were too hard, but I just felt they slowed the level down a bit. Maybe just a few more regular Boos who would chase you in place of those. Still not bad!

I'm pretty happy with the end result.\n\nFeedback is much appreciated!\r\nI think you hit the spot you were going for.  A couple sections you have to be wary of, but nothing too difficult.  The level flows pretty well and feels cohesive as well.  If I could make one small suggestion, I would say to close off the ceiling to the left of the entrance to the \"bonus\" area, it's a lot of empty space if you get up there and decide to explore.  Also, not sure if intentional or not, but it is possible to get onto the roof of the 2nd half of the level.  Might be worth sticking something up there for people that find a way up.  Regardless of those things I think it's a nice level and good first effort.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Inferno313\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust got the game yesterday and just now finished my first course! It's just my attempt at a fairly simple classic-style Mario level. Give it a try and let me know what you think! \n\n(775B-0000-0044-9C75)\r\n(The level name is \"Up and Across!\")\n\nGood job on your first level, it feels very natural.  I'd put the difficulty somewhere around a mid-game difficulty for a standard Mario game.  My two main thoughts:\n\n-The two goomba in the raised platform section both seem dangerously placed.  The first jumped down onto the moving lift, and the second was just about at the edge of the platform when I was jumping to it.  This isn't bad, necessarily, but I wouldn't be surprised to see people dying to both due to limited chance to react.\n-I can easily jump over the flagpole.  Again, not bad really, but I think it pays to be aware of how players might abuse jumps.\n\n(I feel like I'm being overly nitpicky with criticisms, just trying to point out things I notice as I play through... Moving on...)\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Finn\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWould appreciate if you could try mine out: \n\nTitle: B Sharp or B Flat \n101E 0000 0044 520F\r\nThis was directed at someone else, but I couldn't resist a musical title.  This level is definitely on the tricky side, though I think it befits a castle level.  For some of the jumps it's better to move fast rather than wait, so after a couple deaths to retry things the level feel like it flows better.  I thought the hidden area is cleverly signaled as well.  The Bowser Jr. fight at the end feels a bit anticlimactic after the trickiness of the level, but perhaps at that point the player has earned it.  Good level!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by The Giant\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tBowser's 789th Castle\n\n7C67-0000-0044-D08A\r\nCastle #789 starts out deceptively simple, pretty standard castle stuff with some jumps over lava and fiery traps.  The back end gets more and more hectic though, as burning cheep-cheeps try to fry Mario at every chance they get.  But like the nice guy he is, Bowser has seen fit to leave a few extra powerups strewn about to help take the edge off.  Overall I like the design.  The enemies in blocks are bit annoying but mostly ignorable. The only thing that I find frustrating is the large number of cheep-cheeps that build up near the end.  Have to seek higher ground right away!  But, the level is still beatable without too much trouble, so it just makes for a tense finale.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Hyrule Warrior\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tI bought this game on launch day, but I didn't have my Wii U available til today. So far I'm kinda bummed with how so many of the top rated courses are just the flashy \"don't press anything\" type stages. I've really just been longing to see people make unique, but still classic Super Mario stages. Oh well, maybe it'll get there in time.\n\nI've been digging into it as much as I could today. My first stage that I uploaded to get my feet wet, was I just made a backwards version of 1-1 from Super Mario Bros, lol.\n\nI just finished and uploaded my first original stage. I used the SMB3 theme, and I think it's tough but fair like a classic Mario stage could be. \n\nIf anyone is willing to try it out, I'd greatly appreciate it, and would love feedback. here's the ID for it:\n\nBB92-0000-0044-C9E2\n\nIt's called Return to Giant World\r\nI am admittedly a fan of Giant World and the big enemies in this game, so I appreciated this level.  I think the sub-level and the 2nd half are well done, but the beginning left me a little confused.  I presume the piranha plants are meant to be a deterrent in flying over to the pipe, but because so many are offscreen it feels a bit cheap.  That said, it is possible to use invicibility to just run and jump across the piranha platforms to the pipe.  I like the idea of the \"Bowser Bridge\" but it dumps me past the pipe, at a different pipe, that spits me out at the wrong end of the subworld.  I found it a bit confusing and frustrating.  Once I figured out the intended routes the level was quite fun though.  Just as one more note, it is possible to fly over the pipe in the sub-level into nothingness and doom.  I had to check, but as far as I can tell there's nothing over there, so I would suggest securing the area more completely.\n\n------\nWithout a doubt, all of the GAF levels I've played thus far have been a cut above what seems to be popular, or common in the 100-Mario challenges.  I expect this game to last a long time as people get more and more comfortable with designing levels and using all the available tools.  Hopefully I can contribute more good levels\n\nReposted, my most well developed (but very hard) ghost house level:\n\nKamek's Kursed Killer Course\nCode: B519-0000-0034-F467\nStyle: SMW\n\n\n\nBuilding on an idea from the World 3 Castle from SMW, I created this Ghost House for Kamek to torment the player, even as you need him to progress.  The latter part includes some typical Ghost House shenanigans and a deceptively tricky bit of platforming.\n\nAlso, I'd like to share the only level I've uploaded that has received stars outside of GAF:\n\nBowser Jr.'s Security System\nCode: 8959-0000-002A-EA6A\nStyle: SMB3\n\n\n\nBowser Jr. is making his last stand, and has put a gauntlet of obstacles between Mario and himself.  Tackle this classic SMB3-style castle the best way you see fit, and try to find the one powerup that will carry you safely through Jr.'s elite guard.\n\nPlease try my courses and offer any feedback and suggestions you may have.  I will warn that these courses are definitely hard, and intentionally so, but I have tried to make them fair and avoid \"cheap\" or unavoidable deaths and offer alternate solutions to hard sections, and I think I have a good eye as to what makes a hard but enjoyable challenge.\r\n\t\t"

I love the leaf, and SMB3 in general, so yeah I wanted to make something that used it right away. The first Bowser is sorta meant to be a trick...it can be a shortcut, but it's also risky. I suppose a warning would have been a good idea though. The sub area is also just kinda meant to extend the level a little, and me experimenting some more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI just played through your Ghost House stage, and I thought it wasn't bad. I love the SMW theme also, so I dunno if I like your stage, or it's just the nostalgia kicking in lol. That being said, I do think there may have been a few too many ghost circles. Not that they were too hard, but I just felt they slowed the level down a bit. Maybe just a few more regular Boos who would chase you in place of those. Still not bad! Those tricky Boos coming out of the ?s all got me lol\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some more feedback on mine, and I'd enjoy seeing someone play it if you'd wanna try.

Really like how you jumpes straight to giving the super leaf. Its nice to just jump straight into a more dynanic power up. The first part with bowser you should add some coins directing right so the player knows to jump. I didn't realize until it was too late. I liked the sub area but I dunno if there was suppose to be something there. Regardless, I liked the design of it. The bowser junior part I could do without though. Good Level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI liked both of these. I meant to star Two as well. 1 felt like a classic SMB level. Two was good but there are some blind jumps that need to be addressed. The higher up you go the more visual cues there need to be about whether the bottom of the stage is safe. A few times I basically just accepted the jump was possible death because I was unsure if I missed sonething telling me its safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you guys could throw some feedback to my ghost house level that would be cool too.\r\nI tried your level with the Boos and it took me a good five or six times to beat it.

Not only is the difficulty totally out of whack, but things don't work the way you mean for them to. You know those handsome green structures you put your doors in front of? Mario can jump on top of them, and in most cases, since there's no way to get down, that's fatal. This is a huge issue, given how easy it is to do, especially after Bowser Jr.! Also I feel like you haven't put yourself in the mind of a stranger first approaching the level. It's easy to run past the thwomps, but people won't know that until they know what's coming. By that time they'll have mastered a very precise jump next to the thwomp, which ultimately is pointless to practise as your level doesn't even require it. You put too much space between the spinies for spin jumping too. I'd think some of this is accidental, but then you put a boo tied to a rail directly in the path of a vine, as to make him unavoidable, and then you put an invisible block and a piranha plant right before the flag, so as to kill people for all their hard work. (I did beat it though, so, you're welcome.) You're showing no respect to the player and his/her time with that sort of thing. ‎\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, there is too much busywork. Why do I have to get my own trampoline? Why does the part with the shell breaking the bricks, which is mandatory, have to take so long? You have some very sharp ideas here but they're going to waste when you make things so hard on the player. Please don't get discouraged. There's the pieces of a brilliant level here. But you need to playtest the hell out of the next level you make, I'll say that for sure. ‎\r\n\r\n‎\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Painguy\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t‎I'll occasionally check to see who has played my levels, but aside from that no more mario maker hahaha.

One is that the big koopas are almost required to beat this, and if you smack them with another shell, they die and don't regenerate. The other is that if you don't get through to the end on the P block puzzle, the level almost unwinnable -- you can easily grab those coins, especially with the big koopa shell, and have no way to the end. That kinda thing is best saved for bonus stuff, or levels where you succeed in that or die. That aside, really good! It's OK if people find it hard if it's balanced! ‎\r\n‎\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Inferno313\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust got the game yesterday and just now finished my first course!

Give feedback if you'd like, I'd appreciate it.  Will go through levels before me and check them out.\r\n\r\n87B0-0000-003B-330B - Super Meat Boy\r\nHomage to super meat boy level design, fast and saws (hard)\r\n\r\n7872-0000-0039-1D91 - The Long Haul\r\nVery hard.  1 block jumps.  Long.  Instant death\r\nBoth of your levels are a little haphazardly thrown together. It's not a big deal, but aesthetics make levels more appealing to the eye. \r\n\r\nAnother thing is that the difficulty doesn't ramp up in a cohesive way.\r\nFor example, in The Long Hall, you can have two block platforms or something of that nature for the first half to set the pacing, then you can start to do the one block platforms towards the end. It eases players in as opposed to just crushing them at the start. More players will try to make it to the end if you give them a sense of progression.\r\n\r\nSuper Meat Boy was pretty fun. You had some pretty tricky and clever jumps, but I suggest that you have a break in between the level where the player can catch their breath and maybe grab another mushroom. Because the saw obstacles start to blur together at the end, adding a break in between will allow the player to master each segment of the level, and give them a frame of reference to which set of obstacles is next.\r\n\r\nI did beat both as well.\r\n\t\t"

The first one has the first 3 bosses and ends right after. The second one has the flying Bowser Jr. and Bowser himself. It shorter, but maybe harder. I also switched the section before the third and fourth bosses, so that part 2 now starts with the Thwomp section.

That little P-switch moment was funny. The first small chain chomp in the first room is a bit cheap IMO. And putting those coins right before another chain chomp spawns in so you rush ahead to grab them only to get chomped is a dick move lol. But I liked it a lot. I'm surprised at the clear rate right now, it should be higher than that.\r\n\t\t"

Only problem is to wait for the caterpillar to come back if you miss it when you reach his screen.\r\nThanks!\r\nIn my mind if you missed the caterpillar, you must have fallen off the plat-form and thus activated the check point (passing a door reset object positions).\r\nBut if you are not familiar with the environment you will be more careful and slower, I will take note.\r\n\r\nI tried your course, it always feels good to see a classic level!\r\n\r\nYou should make a secret warp here ;)\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by jnWake\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tFun level! Nice idea for the checkpoint, I may steal it haha. First section felt way harder than the second one. Dodging those giant fireballs can be very tricky depending on when you take the rollercoaster.\r\nThank you! I changed the first section, it should be dodge-able at both starting points.\r\n\r\nI tried the shell and the goomba courses, both felt a bit unfair, if you drop the shell or if you activate the wrong platform you're stuck.\r\nThe Thwomp one was good! The last bill bullet is a insidious! ^^'\r\n\t\t"

Platforming is a touch too easy -- there's no showpiece part of the level where I'd recall making a really cool jump or dodging an enemy. As I've said before in other cases, it lacks a bit of drama. Still, what is here is quite good! Thanks for the level!\r\n\t\t"

I've been steadily unlocking materials as I create, so I've been taking a slow and steady approach. I enjoy it though, because that means I can test my creativity with what's currently available.
