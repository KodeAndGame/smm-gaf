Players can base their levels on the gameplay and visual style of Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and New Super Mario Bros. U, <br>with some gameplay mechanics, and enemy behaviour changing accordingly. Those elements are limited to specific game styles while others can be added to game styles that <br>previously did not have them in the original game, such as Boos in Super Mario Bros.<br><br>In addition to traditional Mario elements such as Goombas, warp pipes, and power ups, players can manipulate the behavior of various elements in unique ways. For example,<br>they can stack enemies on top of one another, have hazards come out of question blocks, use shells as protective helmets, and make cannons shoot out coins, enemies, or<br>whatever the creator chooses. These combinations are possible because editing tools in the game work in tandem with one another. This allows players to make any enemy in <br>the game larger by giving them a mushroom, grant them the ability to fly by giving them wings, and so on, with combinations being possible to implement as well. Other elements <br>include the Sound Frog, which adds sound and visual effects to certain parts of the level, including voice recorded messages, and live Miiverse integration.<br><br>Aside from creating levels and sharing them, players can engage with other people&apos;s creations in various ways. This includes browsing the vast catalogue of online creations but<br>also a mode called &apos;100 Mario Challenge&apos; which pits the players against eight (on the Easy difficulty) or sixteen (on the Normal or Expert difficulty) user-created levels with<br>100 lives at their disposal. Beating the challenge unlocks another costume for Mario that can be used in the original Super Mario Bros. style by picking up a Mystery Mushroom.<br>The variety of costumes ranges from the inner circle of Nintendo characters (think Smash roster) to iconic characters from other Nintendo games! Rounding out the package is a<br>&apos;10 Mario challenge&apos; in which the players have to beat eight stages with no more than 10 lives available to them. The eight stages are randomly selected from an array of 68<br>Nintendo-created levels that are included in the game.</blockquote><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ptBHLKH.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NVyHBOl.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"><br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bWy7xhS.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"><blockquote><b>SCREENSHOTS</b><br><br><a href=\"http://abload.de/img/01g9srt.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dAmTZGy.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"http://abload.de/img/0240sbb.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Rbrtbk5.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"http://abload.de/img/03k4su7.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EC8gE7n.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"http://abload.de/img/04n8sud.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NxwuWwK.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://abload.de/img/05k2swr.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kw2pIwX.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"http://abload.de/img/06ansff.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/z2LIbu5.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"http://abload.de/img/07awsbg.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ipLlrqF.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"http://abload.de/img/085fs83.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hona1IU.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a><br><br><b>VIDEOS</b><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_9W_y8IlNro\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7VObiiN.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZwO09vJAPDs\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/p6yYDUV.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/huwCDKlKOt4\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tXg3tqq.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a><br></blockquote><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/r4wRhht.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"><br><blockquote><b>I have so many questions, I don&apos;t even know where to begin!</b><br><br>I urge everyone to read the &apos;Game Features&apos; section as it includes a lot of vital information.<br><br><b>I started playing and I don&apos;t have all the tools available, what gives? I want them as quickly as possible.</b><br><br>With the new update, the levels are unlocked by extensive play in the editor. Here&apos;s the best way to ensure quick unlocks of the new sets: 1. Use all the new items,<br>backgrounds etc. (everything with a &apos;!&apos;), combine items, etc. Just use the new stuff for a while. At that point, you will get a notification that new features &quot;will be available <br>soon&quot;. Now just clear the screen, choose a land block (something you can put down without lifting the stylus) and fill the whole screen with that by going back and forth <br>with the stick. The set that was announced to be arriving &quot;soon&quot; should unlock in a couple of minutes&apos; time. Repeat at your leisure.<br><br><b>Are the individual physics of the four Mario titles recreated in a faithful fashion?</b><br><br>Not exactly. While some idiosyncracies have been accurately reproduced for the different artstyles, a lot of elements had to be standardised across the board for level sharing<br>to work, as well as seamless transitioning from one artstyle to the other. This includes the jumping physics which are based on NSMBU. <a href=\"http://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Maker#Differences_from_base-games\" target=\"_blank\">You can read more about the changes here.</a><br><br><b>Is there a digital version of the booklet that is bundled with the game?</b><br><br>Yup, <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wiiu/amaj/booklet/SuperMarioMakerBooklet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">and you can find it for free right here!</a><br><br><b>Will there be DLC for this game?</b><br><br>The first piece of costume DLC has been announced today. <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vTVJqAA.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">The Famitsu mascot Necky the Fox will be released in Japan soon</a>, details forthcoming. As of now, it is unclear <br>whether that is a one-off and if it will be free or paid DLC.<br><br><b>What&apos;s the maximum size of a level?</b><br><br>10x2 screens with one sub-area (reached via pipes or doors) of the same size. That&apos;s a lot of level to work with!<br><br><b>How many levels can I save locally?</b><br><br>You can have up to 120 creations stored on your Maker profile, including your own. However, you can play levels without downloading them, just like in Trials,<br>for example.<br><br><b>Can I create my own overworlds?</b><br><br>Don&apos;t be silly! You can, however, arrange levels into a world structure locally.<br><br><b>How do I change the hand that is visible on the TV while editing?</b><br><br>Press in the L and R sticks to cycle through the different hands/paws.<br><br><b>Is the frog icon in the level editor a callback to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1txRYhhO3qw\" target=\"_blank\">Frog Hop?</a></b><br><br>If you want it to be, sure!

The goal of this contest is to see how different creators tackle a certain theme and have the community vote on the best entry. To participate, all you have to do is create and submit a level that adheres to the provided requirements. You will find them below:<br><br><u>SMM-GAF Contest #1</u><br><br><b>Theme:</b> Level 1-1 for a new Mario game<br><b>Description:</b> Creating the first level for an entirely new Mario platformer must be a tough task for the level designers at Nintendo. Certain traditions of 1-1 stages must be respected while also avoiding the dangers of being derivative. Now it&apos;s up to you to create a level that would serve as the very first stage of a new Mario game. Think about what direction the game goes in. Think about a new idea that might be featured more heavily and expanded on in certain ways as the game progresses. The first impression is what counts, right?<br><b>Styles:</b> All Styles allowed<br><br><b>Submission deadline:</b> Monday, Sep 21 (12pm GMT+1)<br><b>Voting period:</b> see &apos;Voting Rules&apos;<br><br><u>Submission Rules:</u><br><br>To submit a level, post the code of your level along with a screenshot in this very thread and <b>clearly label it as entry for the contest by putting the following on the top of your post: <i>&apos;Submission for the SMM-GAF Community Contest #1&apos;</i></b>.<br><br>Keep in mind that <b>only one entry per user is allowed.</b> If you wanna retract a level and submit a new one, make that absolutely clear and edit your old post to reflect that change. Please refrain from doing this a lot, better be absolutely sure that the stage you created is the one you wanna submit.<br><br>You can label your level in a way that relates it to our contest but you don&apos;t have to. Just make sure to properly submit a level in here by following the rules above. The deadlines for submitting and voting will be posted above and below, respectively.<br><br>I hope that, first and foremost, a contest like this will help people focus their creativity while trying to work around restrictions (which will undoubtedly become more strict in later tournaments!). Most importantly, though, I hope that everyone has a fun time!<br><br><u>Voting Rules:</u><br><br>Once the deadline for submitting levels is reached, I will assemble all the entries and post the list in here. SMM-GAF will then go ahead and try the levels. You can assign points to up to three levels - your first pick gets three points, your second pick two points, your third pick one point.<br><br><b>The voting will be done in a group format.</b> With 68 entries, I will post four randomly assembled groups of 17 and we&apos;ll vote on one group at a time. Three levels - the ones with the most points - from each group will advance into the final voting group. In the case of a tie in third place, both proceed.<br><br>You can give feedback in the thread and reveal your ranking if you wish. However, <b>you must send me your ballot in a PM,</b> this ensures anonymity for those who want it and, more importantly, gives me an easier time counting your votes. Including the creators&apos; names in the ballot is sufficient. Obviously, you cannot vote for your own levels.<br><br>The <b>deadlines</b> for voting will be the following:<br><br>Group 1 ~ Thursday, Sep 24 (12PM GMT+1)<br>Group 2 ~ Thursday, Oct 1 (12PM GMT+1)<br>Group 3 ~ Tuesday, Oct 6 (12PM GMT+1)<br>Group 4 ~ Sunday, Oct 11 (12PM GMT+1)<br><br>The final three winners will be included in the Community Showcase.<br><br><u>Group
