Players can base their levels on the gameplay and visual style of Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and New Super Mario Bros. U, \nwith some gameplay mechanics, and enemy behaviour changing accordingly. Those elements are limited to specific game styles while others can be added to game styles that \npreviously did not have them in the original game, such as Boos in Super Mario Bros.\n\nIn addition to traditional Mario elements such as Goombas, warp pipes, and power ups, players can manipulate the behavior of various elements in unique ways. For example,\nthey can stack enemies on top of one another, have hazards come out of question blocks, use shells as protective helmets, and make cannons shoot out coins, enemies, or\nwhatever the creator chooses. These combinations are possible because editing tools in the game work in tandem with one another. This allows players to make any enemy in \nthe game larger by giving them a mushroom, grant them the ability to fly by giving them wings, and so on, with combinations being possible to implement as well. Other elements \ninclude the Sound Frog, which adds sound and visual effects to certain parts of the level, including voice recorded messages, and live Miiverse integration.\n\nAside from creating levels and sharing them, players can engage with other people's creations in various ways. This includes browsing the vast catalogue of online creations but\nalso a mode called '100 Mario Challenge' which pits the players against eight (on the Easy difficulty) or sixteen (on the Normal or Expert difficulty) user-created levels with\n100 lives at their disposal. Beating the challenge unlocks another costume for Mario that can be used in the original Super Mario Bros. style by picking up a Mystery Mushroom.\nThe variety of costumes ranges from the inner circle of Nintendo characters (think Smash roster) to iconic characters from other Nintendo games! Rounding out the package is a\n'10 Mario challenge' in which the players have to beat eight stages with no more than 10 lives available to them. The eight stages are randomly selected from an array of 68\nNintendo-created levels that are included in the game.\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n\n   \n\n   \n\nVIDEOS\n\n  \n\nI have so many questions, I don't even know where to begin!\n\nI urge everyone to read the 'Game Features' section as it includes a lot of vital information.\n\nI started playing and I don't have all the tools available, what gives? I want them as quickly as possible.\n\nWith the new update, the levels are unlocked by extensive play in the editor. Here's the best way to ensure quick unlocks of the new sets: 1. Use all the new items,\nbackgrounds etc. (everything with a '!'), combine items, etc. Just use the new stuff for a while. At that point, you will get a notification that new features \"will be available \nsoon\". Now just clear the screen, choose a land block (something you can put down without lifting the stylus) and fill the whole screen with that by going back and forth \nwith the stick. The set that was announced to be arriving \"soon\" should unlock in a couple of minutes' time. Repeat at your leisure.\n\nAre the individual physics of the four Mario titles recreated in a faithful fashion?\n\nNot exactly. While some idiosyncracies have been accurately reproduced for the different artstyles, a lot of elements had to be standardised across the board for level sharing\nto work, as well as seamless transitioning from one artstyle to the other. This includes the jumping physics which are based on NSMBU. You can read more about the changes here.\n\nIs there a digital version of the booklet that is bundled with the game?\n\nYup, and you can find it for free right here!\n\nWill there be DLC for this game?\n\nThe first piece of costume DLC has been announced today. The Famitsu mascot Necky the Fox will be released in Japan soon, details forthcoming. As of now, it is unclear \nwhether that is a one-off and if it will be free or paid DLC.\n\nWhat's the maximum size of a level?\n\n10x2 screens with one sub-area (reached via pipes or doors) of the same size. That's a lot of level to work with!\n\nHow many levels can I save locally?\n\nYou can have up to 120 creations stored on your Maker profile, including your own. However, you can play levels without downloading them, just like in Trials,\nfor example.\n\nCan I create my own overworlds?\n\nDon't be silly! You can, however, arrange levels into a world structure locally.\n\nHow do I change the hand that is visible on the TV while editing?\n\nPress in the L and R sticks to cycle through the different hands/paws.\n\nIs the frog icon in the level editor a callback to Frog Hop?\n\nIf you want it to be, sure! However, the frog icon originally appeared in Mario Paint so your question should be the other way around.\n\nWhat is up with Amiibo?\n\nWhat IS up with Amiibo?\n\n\nThe 8-bit Mario releases in Europe and Australia in two colours - a classic style and a modern style. The classic style releases with the game in a special bundle (see\n'Editions') in Europe whereas modern Mario follows October 23 in Europe and a day later in Australia. Note that US collectors will have to turn to a Walmart bundle(!) for the\nmodern colour palette.\n\nThe classic 8-bit Mario amiibo unlocks a Mega Mushroom in the game which is comparable to the Mega Mushroom found in the NSMB games.\n\nFurthermore, all amiibos that have been released so far are compatible with the game, unlocking a special costume that can be used in the Super Mario Bros. artstyle in-game. \nKeep in mind that these costumes can also be unlocked without amiibo, by way of playing and beating the 100 Mario Challenge (see 'Game Features').\nGiant Bomb - 5/5\n\r\n\t\r\n\tSuper Mario Maker lets you make your own Super Mario Bros. levels and if that isn't enough for you then you're probably beyond help anyway.\r\nIGN - 9\n\r\n\t\r\n\tSuper Mario Maker is a great way to mark Mario’s 30th birthday, but it’s not concerned with being an overwrought history lesson. Instead, it’s a celebration that folds three decades of Mario into one accessible, powerful creation suite. The perpetual joke at the end of every 10 Mario Challenge run informing you that the Princess is in yet another castle hints at Super Mario Maker’s bigger promise: There will always be more levels to play thanks to the online creation community, and a virtually endless pool of challenges to overcome.\r\nGamespot - 9\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThe first time I discovered that, not only could I make a giant, flame-spewing piranha plant, but I could also make it fly, I cackled with horrible glee at the possibilities. And for the first time in a creation-focused experience, I look forward to returning again and again for more than just the amazing levels I know other people will create. I want to keep making my own levels better. The game won't necessarily turn you into the next Shigeru Miyamoto, but you can almost feel a little bit of that magic rubbing off every time you upload a new creation.\r\nUSGamer - 5/5\n\r\n\t\r\n\tNintendo has gone back to perhaps the most important game it ever created for an inspired new creation. Just as Super Mario Bros. redefined the platformer genre, Super Mario Maker redefines the idea of a consumer-level game design toolset. It makes complexity feel simple and creativity addictive, and it does so by drawing upon, and holding true to, the principles of accessibility and polish that made Super Mario Bros. such a landmark all those years ago.\r\nGame Informer - 9\n\r\n\t\r\n\tDespite not being anything close to a game designer, I have spent plenty of time with game-creation tools. I’ve created levels in games like LittleBigPlanet and worlds in Project Spark, but the process always feels time-consuming and complicated. In terms of ease of use and the time required to create something you are proud of, Super Mario Maker is the fastest and most rewarding.\r\nYou can find many more reviews in the review thread! And I wanna give huge thanks to kubus for the beautiful banners!\n\n\r\n\t\t"

The goal of this contest is to see how different creators tackle a certain theme and have the community vote on the best entry. To participate, all you have to do is create and submit a level that adheres to the provided requirements. You will find them below:\n\nSMM-GAF Contest #1\n\nTheme: Level 1-1 for a new Mario game\nDescription: Creating the first level for an entirely new Mario platformer must be a tough task for the level designers at Nintendo. Certain traditions of 1-1 stages must be respected while also avoiding the dangers of being derivative. Now it's up to you to create a level that would serve as the very first stage of a new Mario game. Think about what direction the game goes in. Think about a new idea that might be featured more heavily and expanded on in certain ways as the game progresses. The first impression is what counts, right?\nStyles: All Styles allowed\n\nSubmission deadline: Monday, Sep 21 (12pm GMT+1)\nVoting period: Monday, Sep 21 - Monday, Sep 28 (12pm GMT+1)\n\n\nSubmission Rules:\n\nTo submit a level, post the code of your level along with a screenshot in this very thread and clearly label it as entry for the contest by putting the following on the top of your post: 'Submission for the SMM-GAF Community Contest #1'.\n\nKeep in mind that only one entry per user is allowed. If you wanna retract a level and submit a new one, make that absolutely clear and edit your old post to reflect that change. Please refrain from doing this a lot, better be absolutely sure that the stage you created is the one you wanna submit.\n\nYou can label your level in a way that relates it to our contest but you don't have to. Just make sure to properly submit a level in here by following the rules above.\n\nVoting Rules:\n\nOnce the deadline for submitting levels is reached, I will assemble all the entries and post the list in here. SMM-GAF will then go ahead and try the levels. You can assign points to up to three levels - your first pick gets three points, your second pick two points, your third pick one point.\n\nYou can give feedback in the thread and reveal your ranking if you wish. However, you must send me your ballot in a PM, this ensures anonymity for those who want it and, more importantly, gives me an easier time counting your votes.\n\nThe deadlines for submitting and voting will be posted above. Feel free to quote this post on a new page to spread the word!\n\nI should say that the first three winners will be included in the Community Showcase! However, I hope that, first and foremost, a contest like this will help people focus their creativity while trying to work around restrictions (which will undoubtedly become more strict in later tournaments!). Most importantly, though, I hope that everyone has a fun time!\n\n\n\nIn the Community Showcase I would like to display GAFfer-made levels. If you have played a level you deem worthy, just post about it in the thread or shoot me a PM.\n\n1. Smokin' Skull Stream by Nocturnowl (ID: B4D8-0000-0012-345C)\n\n\n\nAn excellent level that is very reminscent of the game it lent its assets from, it provides a challenge that is always fair thanks to thoughtful design.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by King_Moc\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGood stage! These are the kind of levels we need.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Kensuke\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tVery nice and challenging. I was sweating a little towards the end, but somehow managed it.\r\n2. Jr's Water Park by Kinsei (ID: EABD-0000-0014-D904)\n\n\n\nThis wonderfully creative stage manages to build up a sense of place and a sense of cohesiveness like few others do. The change-up between castle and water theme is pulled off very well, and some of the enemy patterns are among the most interesting I've seen in any water level. Usually, a high level of creativity sends the difficulty curve flying in all sorts of directions, but not here! A very fun ride, indeed.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by mrklaw\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThis was a fantastic level. Maybe a little too chaotic wih thegoombas in the water section, but it was really tense and heart stopping at times. Love the back and forth too, really fleshes it out and gives it a feeling of space.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Sparf (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLovely and inventive design choices!\r\n3. Little Pikmin Adventure by Robin64 (ID: E088-0000-0018-E993)\n\n\n\nNot a difficult stage, probably not even a challenging one. But an exemplary display of how to do a stage with a character theme and a clever approach on how to do a lot with very little while being obscenely charming to boot. The Mario equivalent of a praline!\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Nocturnowl\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSimple but effective in how you used the enlarged enemies to create that sense of scale for the Pikmin.\nI didn't actually know you could be a trio of pikmin, such a neat skin.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by The Wotch (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThat was adorable. And I found Olimar!\r\n4. Sunken Airship by Dimentios (ID: 2053-0000-0012-5786)\n\n\n\nSometimes there's something to be said for rock solid level design. This stage doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does manage to evoke a sense of wonder of exploring a sunken ship, effortlessly combining underwater and ship sections, with very natural enemy placement and a nice sense of pace.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Moe (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGreat attention to detail!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Ricardo (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tExcellent level! Fun theme, reasonable challenge. Keep up the good work!\r\n5. Tonight I Dine On Turtle Soup by ToastyFrog (ID: EDD0-0000-0024-CA8E)\n\n\n\nMany people have tried to recreate stages from other game in Mario Maker. Few have succeeded in the way T-Frog does in his adaptation of the bomb defusal stage from TMNT on the NES. A transformative effort that is as creative as it is fun.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Robin64\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSuperb! Nicely done. Not just a good homage to TMNT but a good swimming level in its own right.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by ehhh (Miiverse)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOddly, more fun than the original...\r\n6. Ruined Castle Romp by Insidious Walrus (ID: 6684-0000-0034-1BD7)\n\n\n\nA different kind of castle stage but a castle stage nonetheless. Filled with lots of alternate paths and secrets, the level gets a chance to breathe without feeling loose and empty. Every obstacle is meticulously and harmoniously placed - a study in elegance despite its brutalistic theme.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Belgian Dude\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tReally really fun! Congrats - difficult yet fair - the fireball segment was pretty tough for me! Really like the shortcut over the Thwomps.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Dad\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOk, of the traditional Super Mario levels so far, I think this is by far my favorite. It's just REALLY tightly designed. Incredible work\r\n7. Pipe-opolis by UncleSporky (ID: BA66-0000-002A-4DB2)\n\n\n\nA master class in pipe level design. Contrary to most level of a similar aesthetic, the stage doesn't feel cluttered and chaotic. It flows brilliantly and is a testament to the creator's eye for striking layout and geometry. A phantastical piple jungle that needs to be experienced.\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by jholmes\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIt’s 1990 and there’s a new World 7 stage! The hidden area near the end was vintage SMB3. Very good stage, definitely one of the best I’ve played. Big-time recommend.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOriginally Posted by Crimson_Justice\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tDarn good level right here. I agree with you on the nice aesthetic and the end as a cave being better - it felt like I made my way out of a pipe maze and was satisfying.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nThe GAF creator database (courtesy of ramparter)\n\nNOTE: Only one level is enough. The purpose is to allow you the other gaffers to find you, follow you and get to see your other levels too.\n\nQuote post to see the form link here:\nForm\n\nQuote post to view the levels here:\nLevels\n\nAnd last, but not least - UncleSporky's Guide For Designing Good™ Mario Levels\n\n\r\n\t\t"
